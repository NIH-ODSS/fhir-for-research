## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop introduces researchers to FHIR data analysis and clinical decision support implementation, with a focus on genomics applications.

## Prerequisites

-   Basic familiarity with Python and JavaScript will allow for a deeper understanding but you can follow the workshop notebooks without prior experience.
-   Web browser (Chrome recommended)
-   Google account to access Google Colab (optional)
-   Recommended background: Basic understanding of FHIR concepts
    -   See our [FHIR from 1,000 Feet](/modules/fhir-from-1000-ft.qmd) module for introductory material
    -   For Part 2, familiarity with [Genomics Data Standardization with FHIR](/modules/genomics.qmd)
    -   Helpful concepts: [CDS Hooks](/modules/new-cds-hooks-intro.qmd) and [SMART on FHIR](/modules/new-smart-on-fhir-intro.qmd)

## Synthetic Data

This tutorial uses the Synthea Coherent Data Set, a comprehensive synthetic health dataset that includes:

-   FHIR resources
-   Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM, an international standard for storing, retrieving, and sending medical imaging like those from an MRI, CT scan, or x-ray) images
-   Genomic data
-   Physiological data (ECGs)
-   Clinical notes

The dataset is managed by The MITRE Corporation and is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. It's specifically designed to provide realistic, linked healthcare data for development and testing. For more information, see [Synthea Overview](/modules/synthea-overview.qmd).

**Access:**

The dataset can be downloaded from the [Synthea downloads page](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads). You only need to download the data if you are running your own server. For more information on running your own server, see [Standing Up a FHIR Testing Server](/modules/synthea-test-server.qmd).

## Environment Setup {#environment-setup}

Running the two interactive Jupyter notebooks in this workshop may require some local setup. There are four options, listed below. The first, Google Colab, is the recommended method since it requires the least amount of setup, but the other options are also viable and might be the right fit for different needs. 

At the top of each notebook, you will see a series of badges like those below:

Identify one of the setup options to use, follow the necessary instructions, and then proceed to [Workshop Materials](#workshop-materials) and use your chosen setup option in the notebook.

### Option 1: Google Colab [**✓ recommended**]{style="color:green"}

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a web-based tool for interacting with Jupyter notebooks.

1.  Open one of the workshop's notebooks and click the "Open in Colab" badge
2.  File → Save a copy in Drive to edit 3. No additional setup required

### Important Security Note:

When working with PII/PHI data from your own FHIR server, only use local installations, like JupyterLab Desktop. Cloud-based solutions like Google Colab should not be used with sensitive data unless the solution has been approved by your organization. Always consult your institutional policies before processing sensitive information in cloud environments.
:::

### Option 2: NBViewer (View Only)

1.  Click the "View in NBViewer" link on any notebook
2.  This provides a **non-interactive view** of the notebook with all outputs
3.  Good for reviewing code and results without running anything

### Option 3: JupyterLab Desktop (Easy Local Setup)

1.  Download and install JupyterLab Desktop from the [official website](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation)
2.  Follow the instructions for launching [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#launching-jupyterlab-desktop)
3.  Open a workshop notebook and select "Download Notebook."
4.  Open the downloaded notebook in JupyterLab Desktop
5.  Each notebook includes its own dependency cell that will install any additional required packages

### Option 4: Binder

Click the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) badge on any notebook for a temporary environment (slower but no setup required).
