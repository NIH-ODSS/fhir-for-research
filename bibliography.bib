              Objective
              Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.


              Materials and Methods
              The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.


              Results
              Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access.


              Conclusions
              The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association}, author={Haendel, Melissa A and Chute, Christopher G and Bennett, Tellen D and Eichmann, David A and Guinney, Justin and Kibbe, Warren A and Payne, Philip R O and Pfaff, Emily R and Robinson, Peter N and Saltz, Joel H and Spratt, Heidi and Suver, Christine and Wilbanks, John and Wilcox, Adam B and Williams, Andrew E and Wu, Chunlei and Blacketer, Clair and Bradford, Robert L and Cimino, James J and Clark, Marshall and Colmenares, Evan W and Francis, Patricia A and Gabriel, Davera and Graves, Alexis and Hemadri, Raju and Hong, Stephanie S and Hripscak, George and Jiao, Dazhi and Klann, Jeffrey G and Kostka, Kristin and Lee, Adam M and Lehmann, Harold P and Lingrey, Lora and Miller, Robert T and Morris, Michele and Murphy, Shawn N and Natarajan, Karthik and Palchuk, Matvey B and Sheikh, Usman and Solbrig, Harold and Visweswaran, Shyam and Walden, Anita and Walters, Kellie M and Weber, Griffin M and Zhang, Xiaohan Tanner and Zhu, Richard L and Amor, Benjamin and Girvin, Andrew T and Manna, Amin and Qureshi, Nabeel and Kurilla, Michael G and Michael, Sam G and Portilla, Lili M and Rutter, Joni L and Austin, Christopher P and Gersing, Ken R and the N3C Consortium}, year={2021}, month=mar, pages={427–443}, language={en} }

            Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the ‘black-box’ criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated (‘labelled’) data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.}, number={25}, journal={European Heart Journal}, author={Krittanawong, Chayakrit and Johnson, Kipp W and Rosenson, Robert S and Wang, Zhen and Aydar, Mehmet and Baber, Usman and Min, James K and Tang, W H Wilson and Halperin, Jonathan L and Narayan, Sanjiv M}, year={2019}, month=jul, pages={2058–2073}, language={en} }

            Artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed substantially to the resolution of a variety of biomedical problems, including cancer, over the past decade. Deep learning, a subfield of AI that is highly flexible and supports automatic feature extraction, is increasingly being applied in various areas of both basic and clinical cancer research. In this review, we describe numerous recent examples of the application of AI in oncology, including cases in which deep learning has efficiently solved problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable, and we address obstacles that must be overcome before such application can become more widespread. We also highlight resources and datasets that can help harness the power of AI for cancer research. The development of innovative approaches to and applications of AI will yield important insights in oncology in the coming decade.}, number={5}, journal={Cancer Science}, author={Shimizu, Hideyuki and Nakayama, Keiichi I.}, year={2020}, month=may, pages={1452–1460}, language={en} }

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Electronic data capture (EDC) in academic health care organizations provides an opportunity for the management, aggregation, and secondary use of research and clinical data. It is especially important in resource-constrained environments such as the South African public health care sector, where paper records are still the main form of clinical record keeping. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the strategies followed by the University of the Witwatersrand Faculty of Health Sciences (Wits FHS) during the period from 2013 to 2021 to overcome resistance to, and encourage the adoption of, the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) system by academic and clinical staff. REDCap has found wide use in varying domains, including clinical studies and research projects as well as administrative, financial, and human resource applications. Given REDCap's global footprint in {$>$}5000 institutions worldwide and potential for future growth, the strategies followed by the Wits FHS to support users and encourage adoption may be of importance to others using the system, particularly in resource-constrained settings. METHODS: The strategies to support users and encourage adoption included top-down organizational support; secure and reliable application, hosting infrastructure, and systems administration; an enabling and accessible REDCap support team; regular hands-on training workshops covering REDCap project setup and data collection instrument design techniques; annual local symposia to promote networking and awareness of all the latest software features and best practices for using them; participation in REDCap Consortium activities; and regular and ongoing mentorship from members of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. RESULTS: During the period from 2013 to 2021, the use of the REDCap EDC system by individuals at the Wits FHS increased, respectively, from 129 active user accounts to 3447 active user accounts. The number of REDCap projects increased from 149 in 2013 to 12,865 in 2021. REDCap at Wits also supported various publications and research outputs, including journal articles and postgraduate monographs. As of 2020, a total of 233 journal articles and 87 postgraduate monographs acknowledged the use of the Wits REDCap system. CONCLUSIONS: By providing reliable infrastructure and accessible support resources, we were able to successfully implement and grow the REDCap EDC system at the Wits FHS and its associated academic medical centers. We believe that the increase in the use of REDCap was driven by offering a dependable, secure service with a strong end-user training and support model. This model may be applied by other academic and health care organizations in resource-constrained environments planning to implement EDC technology.},

	abstractNote={The last twenty years of health care research has seen a steady stream of common health care data models implemented for multi-organization research. Each model offers a uniform interface on data from the diverse organizations that implement them, enabling the sharing of research tools and data. While the groups designing the models have had various needs and aims, and the data available has changed significantly in this time, there are nevertheless striking similarities between them. This paper traces the evolution of common data models, describing their similarities and points of departure., We believe the history of this work should be understood and preserved. The work has empowered collaborative research across competing organizations and brought together researchers from clinical practice, universities and research institutes around the planet. Understanding the eco-system of data models designed for collaborative research allows readers to evaluate where we have been, where we are going as a field, and to evaluate the utility of different models to their own work.},
