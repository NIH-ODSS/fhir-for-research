    "text": "Introduction\n\nLearning Objectives and Key Concepts\nThe goal of this workshop is to connect to the SMART Bulk Data Server and fetch a set of sample patient data.\nIn this exercise, you will:\n\nConnect to an authorization server using a provided key, and retrieve an access token\nMake a Bulk Data Export Request with that access token\nDownload the exported Bulk Data\nConvert the downloaded data into DataFrames\n\nWhile libraries like FHIR-PYrate allow you to fetch data from a server and parse it directly into a DataFrame, these libraries generally do not support FHIR Bulk Data. This workshop will step through the process of building up a tool to fetch Bulk Data and convert it into DataFrames.\nThis notebook is best experienced interactively. If the notebook already has output in it, you may clear that prior to starting via the menu: Cell -&gt; All Output -&gt; Clear.\n\n\nSetup\nIf you are not using a JupyterHub instance with dependencies already installed, you will need to:\n\nClone this repository\nInstall dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt\nRun jupyter notebook workshops/fhir-bulk-data\n\nThis should open the Jupyter environment in your browser window. You should see notebook.ipynb listed in the interface. Open this notebook in Jupyter, and you should be able to run the code.\n\n\nBackground\nThe Bulk Data Access standard enables researchers to retrieve large volumes of data from a patient population in an EHR. The Bulk Data Access standard is part of the SMART ecosystem, and SMART on FHIR can be used to authenticate and authorize applications that retrieve bulk data automatically\nClients of FHIR Bulk Data servers use SMART Backend Authorization to connect to the server. With SMART Backend Authorization, registered clients make a signed request to a token endpoint to receive a Bearer token, which they use for subsequent calls to the FHIR server.\nClient registration often happens manually as a separate one-time event. The SMART Backend Authorization specification does not define an API for registration.\nFor this workshop, we connect to the SMART Bulk Data Server (https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org). This is a developer tool provided by SMART Health IT to facilitate development with Bulk Data Access. This test server allows clients to “register” on the launch page by providing either a URL for a JSON Web Key Set(JWKS) or a raw JWKS. In this case, “registration” is not stored on the server. Instead, the FHIR Server URL contains the “registration” information stored as state in the URL and clientID. Production servers will usually have a more standard registration process rather than taking this approach.\nFor convenience, the SMART Bulk Data Server launch page allows users to generate a one-off JWKS to use for testing. For production usage, clients must generate their own certificates and JWKS and keep the private key private. In this workshop, we will use a JWKS generated by the launch page.\nIMPORTANT: this workshop is not meant to be a formal documentation of the specification, and largely skips error handling and stays on the “happy path” for brevity and readability. We strongly recommend reviewing the specifications and adding error handling before using any of this code in a production environment.\n\n# The default style for rendering JSON parsed as Python dicts isn't the best.\n# Use this import and call `print(json)` when we want a cleaner view.\n\nfrom rich import print\n\n# Status bars for long-running cels\nfrom tqdm.notebook import trange, tqdm"

    "section": "Getting our Access Token",
    "text": "Getting our Access Token\nThe first step in obtaining data from a FHIR server that supports Bulk Data Access is to obtain an access token. That access token identifies and authorizes the client on requests made to the FHIR resource server.\nObtaining an access token is itself a two-step process: 1. Make a discovery request to the FHIR resource server to get the address of the authorization server. 2. Post a token request, signed by the client’s private key, to the authorization server\nTo keep the focus of this workshop on the Bulk Data process rather than the details of generating keys, we will use a JWKS pre-generated by the SMART Bulk Data server launch page.\nFor reference, the steps followed to generate the keys used here were:\n\nVisit the SMART Bulk Data Server launch page\nIn the upper left, click the JWKS button for Authentication\nClick the Generate button and choose Generate RS384\nChoose R4 for the FHIR Version\nThe associated text box now contains a JWKS with both a public and private key, and the Launch Configuration contains a FHIR Server URL and Client ID\nConvert the private key from the JWKS to “PEM” format so it can be used by Python (this is not easy to do natively in Python, so we have done it with JavaScript out of band)\n\nLet’s start by defining our credentials. In practice, real credentials must always be stored and loaded securely, but for simplicity in this workshop we will define them as local variables.\n\nclient_id = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InJlZ2lzdHJhdGlvbi10b2tlbiJ9.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.j1urst068-21CxiH0Nqml7XoE9v6hWJ_vfqAK4W22vg'\n\n\n# Don't worry!

Let’s fetch that endpoint and review the contents.\n\nr = session.get(f'{server_url}/.well-known/smart-configuration')\nsmart_config = r.json()\n\nprint(smart_config)\n\n{\n    'token_endpoint': 'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/auth/token',\n    'registration_endpoint': 'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/auth/register',\n    'token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported': ['private_key_jwt'],\n    'token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported': [\n        'HS256',\n        'HS384',\n        'HS512',\n        'RS256',\n        'RS384',\n        'RS512',\n        'ES256',\n        'ES384',\n        'ES512',\n        'PS256',\n        'PS384',\n        'PS512'\n    ],\n    'scopes_supported': [\n        'system/*.rs',\n        'system/Patient.rs',\n        'system/Encounter.rs',\n        'system/Condition.rs',\n        'system/Claim.rs',\n        'system/ExplanationOfBenefit.rs',\n        'system/Observation.rs',\n        'system/Immunization.rs',\n        'system/DiagnosticReport.rs',\n        'system/Procedure.rs',\n        'system/CareTeam.rs',\n        'system/CarePlan.rs',\n        'system/MedicationRequest.rs',\n        'system/AllergyIntolerance.rs',\n        'system/Device.rs',\n        'system/ImagingStudy.rs',\n        'system/Organization.rs',\n        'system/Practitioner.rs',\n        'system/DocumentReference.rs',\n        'system/Group.rs',\n        'system/*.read',\n        'system/Patient.read',\n        'system/Encounter.read',\n        'system/Condition.read',\n        'system/Claim.read',\n        'system/ExplanationOfBenefit.read',\n        'system/Observation.read',\n        'system/Immunization.read',\n        'system/DiagnosticReport.read',\n        'system/Procedure.read',\n        'system/CareTeam.read',\n        'system/CarePlan.read',\n        'system/MedicationRequest.read',\n        'system/AllergyIntolerance.read',\n        'system/Device.read',\n        'system/ImagingStudy.read',\n        'system/Organization.read',\n        'system/Practitioner.read',\n        'system/DocumentReference.read',\n        'system/Group.read'\n    ],\n    'capabilities': ['permission-v2', 'permission-v1', 'client-confidential-asymmetric']\n}\n\n\n\nWe care most about the token_endpoint field, which we need to request our JWT. For more information about the other fields, see here.\n\ntoken_endpoint = smart_config['token_endpoint']\n\nNow we have our token endpoint, so we can make a request to it to get a token. The request follows the OAuth 2.0 “Client Credentials” flow, using a JSON Web Token (JWT) assertion containing our client ID and signed with our private key.\n📘 Read more about the access token request specification\n\n# Create a JWT client assertion as follows:\nimport jwt\nimport datetime\n\nassertion = jwt.encode({\n        'iss': client_id,   # \"iss\" == \"issuer\", the client that created this JWT\n        'sub': client_id,   # \"sub\" == \"subject\", the client that will use the access token\n        'aud': token_endpoint,  # \"aud\" == \"audience\", the receiver of this request\n        'exp': int((datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=5)).timestamp())\n    },\n    private_key,  # signed with the private key\n    algorithm='RS384', # algorithm for the key\n    headers={\"kid\": key_id}) # kid is required for smart bulk data server\n\n\n# And then POST it to the token endpont\nr = session.post(token_endpoint, data={\n    'scope': 'system/*.read',\n    'grant_type': 'client_credentials',\n    'client_assertion_type': 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer',\n    'client_assertion': assertion\n})\n\ntoken_response = r.json()\n\n# And inspect the response:\ntoken_response\n\n{'token_type': 'bearer',\n 'scope': 'system/*.read',\n 'expires_in': 300,\n 'access_token': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYmVhcmVyIiwic2NvcGUiOiJzeXN0ZW0vKi5yZWFkIiwiZXhwaXJlc19pbiI6MzAwLCJpYXQiOjE2ODY2NTQzNTIsImV4cCI6MTY4NjY1NDY1Mn0.6VcZfI7YBkrGV7IoIBKmQo2usjrpCkIgmJHx8jFir3g'}\n\n\nTwo important fields we need to keep track of are the token itself, and the expire time. Tokens are only valid for a certain amount of time, and once they expire we will need to fetch a new one via the same process as above. expires_in is in seconds from the current time, so we’ll add that to the current time to get a timestamp we can compare against.\nNote that for this example we requested and received 'scope': 'system/*.read' which allows access to all resource types. In practice, requesting access to all resource types is generally not recommended, and servers do not always support asking for * scopes. Generally it is recommended to request only the minimal level of access necessary.\n\ntoken = token_response['access_token']\nexpire_time = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=token_response['expires_in'])\n\nTo make this easier for ourselves, let’s package this up into a get_token() function that we can call anytime we need to use a token. If the current token is still valid, use that, or if it has expired, fetch a new one. The logic is exactly the same as the previous steps we just ran:\n\ndef get_token():\n    global token, expire_time\n    if datetime.datetime.now() &lt; expire_time:\n        # the existing token is still valid so return it\n        return token\n\n    assertion = jwt.encode({\n            'iss': client_id,\n            'sub': client_id,\n            'aud': token_endpoint,\n            'exp': int((datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=5)).timestamp())\n    }, private_key, algorithm='RS384',\n    headers={\"kid\": key_id})\n\n    r = session.post(token_endpoint, data={\n        'scope': 'system/*.read',\n        'grant_type': 'client_credentials',\n        'client_assertion_type': 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer',\n        'client_assertion': assertion\n    })\n\n    token_response = r.json()\n    token = token_response['access_token']\n    expire_time = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=token_response['expires_in'])\n\n    return token"

    "text": "Starting, Checking, and Downloading the Export\nNow that we have an access token, the next step in using Bulk Data is to request the export of data, via a “kick-off request”. This is an asynchronous request – once the request is accepted, instead of returning the results directly, the server response will point to a URL where the client can check the status.\nThere are three levels of export: - Patient, to obtain resources related to all Patients - Group, to obtain resources associated with a particular Group - System, to obtain all resources, whether or not they are associated with a patient\nFor this exercise we will initially only request Patient-level data, but the general process for Groups and System-level data is exactly the same - there is just a different endpoint to hit, and a different set of data will be returned.\nThere are also a number of parameters that may be set, but to keep things simple we will only use the _type parameter, to request only Patient and Condition resource types.\n📘 Read more about the Bulk Data Kick-off Request\nLet’s make the export request and inspect the response headers. For “Patient” level data, the URL we want to hit is {server}/Patient/$export. Our token is used in the “Authorization” header in the format \"Bearer {token}\".\n\nr = session.get(f'{server_url}/Patient/$export?_type=Patient,Condition',\n                headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {get_token()}',\n                         'Accept': 'application/fhir+json',\n                         'Prefer': 'respond-async'})\n\nprint(r.headers)\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'Content-Location': \n'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/fhir/bulkstatus/55e2770a4b9c3f861f002634bd44ac62', 'Content-Type': \n'application/json; charset=utf-8', 'Content-Length': '644', 'Etag': 'W/\"284-G8JHR+JPFTg+y5JhfrRbOzc4ZMI\"', 'Date': \n'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:05:52 GMT', 'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nWe see the status URL in the Content-Location header, so let’s save that into a variable.\n\ncheck_url = r.headers['Content-Location']\n\nWe can now check the status by getting that URL, and the HTTP status code of the response will indicate the exort status. - Code 200 means the export is complete, and the response body will indicate the location - Code 202 means the export is still in progress - Codes in the range 4xx-5xx indicate an error has occurred. 4xx codes generally indicate an error in the request, and 5xx codes generally indicate a server error.\nNote that in production environments it is recommended to check the status as infrequently as possible, to minimize the load on the server. In this case we expect the export to complete in just a few seconds so the impact of checking every two seconds is minimal. The server will also include a “Retry-After” header which will give us a hint on how long to wait before trying again. We’ll check that status in a loop, and break out of the loop when we get a complete or error response. We’ll print status each time through the loop, and the response body when the export is complete.\n\n# Now we check the status in a loop\n\nfrom time import sleep\n\nwhile True:\n    r = session.get(check_url, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {get_token()}', 'Accept': 'application/fhir+json'})\n\n    if r.status_code == 200:\n        # complete\n        response = r.json()\n        print(response)\n        break\n\n    elif r.status_code == 202:\n        # in progress\n        print(r.headers)\n\n        delay = r.headers['Retry-After']\n\n        print(f\"Sleeping {delay} seconds before retrying\")\n        sleep(int(delay))\n\n    else:\n        # error\n        print(r.text)\n\n        break\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'X-Progress': '1% complete, currenly \nprocessing Patient resources', 'Retry-After': '2', 'Date': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:05:52 GMT', 'Content-Length': '0', \n'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nSleeping 2 seconds before retrying\n\n\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'X-Progress': '21% complete, currenly \nprocessing Patient resources', 'Retry-After': '2', 'Date': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:05:54 GMT', 'Content-Length': '0', \n'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nSleeping 2 seconds before retrying\n\n\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'X-Progress': '42% complete, currenly \nprocessing Patient resources', 'Retry-After': '2', 'Date': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:05:56 GMT', 'Content-Length': '0', \n'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nSleeping 2 seconds before retrying\n\n\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'X-Progress': '63% complete, currenly \nprocessing Patient resources', 'Retry-After': '2', 'Date': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:05:58 GMT', 'Content-Length': '0', \n'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nSleeping 2 seconds before retrying\n\n\n\n{'Server': 'Cowboy', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Powered-By': 'Express', 'X-Progress': '83% complete, currenly \nprocessing Patient resources', 'Retry-After': '2', 'Date': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 11:06:00 GMT', 'Content-Length': '0', \n'Via': '1.1 vegur'}\n\n\n\nSleeping 2 seconds before retrying\n\n\n\n{\n    'transactionTime': '1686654352606',\n    'request': \n'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJlcnIiOiIiLCJwYWdlIjoxMDAwMCwiZHVyIjoxMCwidGx0IjoxNSwibSI6MSwic3R1Ijo0LCJkZW\nwiOjB9/fhir/Patient/$export?_type=Patient,Condition',\n    'requiresAccessToken': True,\n    'output': [\n        {\n            'type': 'Condition',\n            'count': 639,\n            'url': \n'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJpZCI6IjU1ZTI3NzBhNGI5YzNmODYxZjAwMjYzNGJkNDRhYzYyIiwib2Zmc2V0IjowLCJsaW1pdC\nI6NjM5LCJzZWN1cmUiOnRydWV9/fhir/bulkfiles/1.Condition.ndjson'\n        },\n        {\n            'type': 'Patient',\n            'count': 100,\n            'url': \n'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJpZCI6IjU1ZTI3NzBhNGI5YzNmODYxZjAwMjYzNGJkNDRhYzYyIiwib2Zmc2V0IjowLCJsaW1pdC\nI6MTAwLCJzZWN1cmUiOnRydWV9/fhir/bulkfiles/1.Patient.ndjson'\n        }\n    ],\n    'deleted': [],\n    'error': []\n}\n\n\n\nWe can see that the response points us to one or more NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) files per resource type, in the output field of the response.\nNote that in this case the volume of data is relatively small, and there is only one entry in the list per resource type, but for large datasets it is possible that there could be multiple files (and therefore multiple entries in this list) per resource type.\nLet’s save that list to a variable.\n\noutput_files = response['output']\noutput_files\n\n[{'type': 'Condition',\n  'count': 639,\n  'url': 'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJpZCI6IjU1ZTI3NzBhNGI5YzNmODYxZjAwMjYzNGJkNDRhYzYyIiwib2Zmc2V0IjowLCJsaW1pdCI6NjM5LCJzZWN1cmUiOnRydWV9/fhir/bulkfiles/1.Condition.ndjson'},\n {'type': 'Patient',\n  'count': 100,\n  'url': 'https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org/eyJpZCI6IjU1ZTI3NzBhNGI5YzNmODYxZjAwMjYzNGJkNDRhYzYyIiwib2Zmc2V0IjowLCJsaW1pdCI6MTAwLCJzZWN1cmUiOnRydWV9/fhir/bulkfiles/1.Patient.ndjson'}]\n\n\nNow we can loop through the list and download each one.

fields?\nLet’s follow the same pattern the FHIR-PYrate library uses, and use FHIRPath to define the fields we want to extract, along with a friendly name. For this we’ll use the fhirpathpy library.\nFHIRPath is:\n\na path based navigation and extraction language, somewhat like XPath. Operations are expressed in terms of the logical content of hierarchical data models, and support traversal, selection and filtering of data.\n\nIf you are not familiar with FHIRPath, Section 3 of the FHIRPath spec describes some of the basics.\n\nimport fhirpathpy\n\nfhir_paths = [\n        [\"id\", \"identifier[0].value\"],\n        [\"gender\", \"gender\"],\n        [\"date_of_birth\", \"birthDate\"],\n        [\"marital_status\", \"maritalStatus.coding.first().code\"]\n    ]\n\n# compile the fhirpath so they can be reused. this will result in better performance on large datasets\nfor f in fhir_paths:\n     f[1] = fhirpathpy.compile(f[1])\n\nfor resource_type, resources in resources_by_type.items():\n    filtered_resources = []\n\n    for resource in resources:\n        filtered_resource = {}\n        for f in fhir_paths:\n            fieldname = f[0]\n            func = f[1]\n            filtered_resource[fieldname] = func(resource)\n\n            # fhirpathpy always returns a list, which can make the DataFrame messy\n            # if it's a list with only one item, extract the item from the list\n            if isinstance(filtered_resource[fieldname], list) and len(filtered_resource[fieldname]) == 1:\n                filtered_resource[fieldname] = filtered_resource[fieldname][0]\n\n        filtered_resources.append(filtered_resource)\n\n    resource_dfs[resource_type] = pd.json_normalize(list(map(lambda r: flatten(r), filtered_resources)))\n\n\nresource_dfs['Patient']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ngender\ndate_of_birth\nmarital_status\n\n\n\n\n0\n6c5d9ca9-54d7-42f5-bfae-a7c19cd217f2\nmale\n1965-01-13\nM\n\n\n1\n58c297c4-d684-4677-8024-01131d93835e\nfemale\n1971-04-05\nM\n\n\n2\n538a9a4e-8437-47d3-8c01-1a17dca8f0be\nmale\n1923-03-24\nM\n\n\n3\nc6c60742-8694-46e4-bb42-b00bf6d8b536\nfemale\n1965-10-27\nM\n\n\n4\nfbfec681-d357-4b28-b1d2-5db6434c7846\nfemale\n1942-07-04\nM\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n95\n5efb1ac1-d29b-40a5-a3d1-2d682f10bfa7\nmale\n1995-10-19\nS\n\n\n96\nc1981741-f90e-4077-9156-429a3c4c5ded\nmale\n1956-05-06\nM\n\n\n97\nf98b23bf-4443-46d0-9eaf-563e767cf948\nmale\n1966-02-07\nM\n\n\n98\nc536dee9-9ef6-4807-ae20-9f1045c9c7d6\nmale\n1990-11-18\nS\n\n\n99\na845ead4-d9de-42eb-b4b5-eb21a8963578\nfemale\n1968-04-20\nS\n\n\n\n\n100 rows × 4 columns"

The test data from https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org may not have all the data elements you need for a specific research use case.

Below we’ll look at how to load .ndjson from Synthea into this notebook and use reprocess_dataframes() with FHIRPaths to convert into Pandas DataFrames.\nFirst, we’ll create a short class to mimic the functionality of BulkDataFetcher but with loading the .ndjson directly from disk rather than via a bulk data export.\n\nclass SyntheaDataFetcher:\n    def __init__(self, ndjson_file_path):\n        self.resources_by_type = {}\n\n        num_lines = sum(1 for line in open(ndjson_file_path,'r'))\n        with open(ndjson_file_path, 'r') as file:\n            for line in tqdm(file, total=num_lines):\n                json_obj = json.loads(line)\n                this_resource_type = json_obj['resourceType']\n                if this_resource_type not in self.resources_by_type:\n                    self.resources_by_type[this_resource_type] = []\n                self.resources_by_type[this_resource_type].append(json_obj)\n\n        print(\"Resources available: \")\n        print('\\n'.join(['- '+ x for x in self.resources_by_type.keys()]))\n\n    def get_example_resource(self, resource_type: str, resource_id: Optional[str] = None):\n        if self.resources_by_type is None:\n            print(\"You need to run get_dataframes() first\")\n            return None\n\n        if resource_type not in self.resources_by_type:\n            print(f\"{resource_type} not available.

The first, Google Colab, is the recommended method since it requires the least amount of setup, but the other options are also viable and might be the right fit for different needs.\nAt the top of each notebook, you will see a series of badges like those below:\n   \nIdentify one of the setup options to use, follow the necessary instructions, and then proceed to Workshop Materials and use your chosen setup option in the notebook.\n\nOption 1: Google Colab ✓ recommended\nGoogle Colab is a web-based tool for interacting with Jupyter notebooks.\n\nOpen one of the workshop’s notebooks and click the “Open in Colab” badge\nFile → Save a copy in Drive to edit 3. No additional setup required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Security Note:\n\n\n\nWhen working with PII/PHI data from your own FHIR server, only use local installations, like JupyterLab Desktop. Cloud-based solutions like Google Colab should not be used with sensitive data unless the solution has been approved by your organization. Always consult your institutional policies before processing sensitive information in cloud environments.\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: NBViewer (View Only)\n\nClick the “View in NBViewer” link on any notebook\nThis provides a non-interactive view of the notebook with all outputs\nGood for reviewing code and results without running anything\n\n\n\nOption 3: JupyterLab Desktop (Easy Local Setup)\n\nDownload and install JupyterLab Desktop from the official website\nFollow the instructions for launching JupyterLab Desktop\nOpen a workshop notebook and select “Download Notebook.”\nOpen the downloaded notebook in JupyterLab Desktop\nEach notebook includes its own dependency cell that will install any additional required packages\n\n\n\nOption 4: Binder\nClick the Binder badge on any notebook for a temporary environment (slower but no setup required).",

Use the above button depending on your chosen setup option.\nData analysis approaches in Python often use Pandas DataFrames to store tabular data. There are two primary approaches to loading FHIR-formatted data into Pandas DataFrames:\n\nWriting Python code to manually convert FHIR instances in JSON format into DataFrames.\nThis does not require any special skills beyond data manipulation in Python, but in practice can be laborious (especially with large number of data elements) and prone to bugs.\nUsing a purpose-built library like FHIR-PYrate to automatically convert FHIR instances into DataFrames.\nIt is recommended to try this approach first, and only fall back to (1) if needed.\n\nIn this tutorial, we’re using a FHIR server located at http://localhost:8080/fhir but any FHIR server loaded with appropriate data can be used.

FHIR-PYrate does this by taking an element from the FHIR-formatted data like Patient.identifier[0].value and converting to an underscore-delimited column name like identifier_0_value. (Note that Patient.identifier has multiple values in the FHIR data, so there are multiple identifier_N_... columns in the DataFrame.)\nFHIR to DataFrame Mapping Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFHIR JSON Structure\nDataFrame Column Name\n\n\n\n\n{\"identifier\": [{\"value\": \"123\"}]}\nidentifier_0_value\n\n\n{\"name\": [{\"family\": \"Smith\"}]}\nname_0_family\n\n\n{\"telecom\": [{\"system\": \"phone\", \"value\": \"555-1234\"}]}\ntelecom_0_system, telecom_0_value\n\n\n\nThis mapping allows you to access nested FHIR data using familiar DataFrame operations.",

    "text": "Selecting specific columns (Intermediate Level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3: Intermediate Skills Check\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore proceeding with this section, ensure you can:\n\nUnderstand FHIR resource structure\nWork with basic DataFrame operations\nRead FHIRPath syntax\n\nPractice Exercise:\nTry modifying the previous code to only retrieve patient names and birth dates.\n\n\n\nUsually not every single value from a FHIR instance is needed for analysis. There are two ways to get a more concise DataFrame:\n\nUse the approach above to load all elements into a DataFrame, remove the unneeded columns, and rename the remaining columns as needed. The process_function capability in FHIR-PYrate allows you to integrate this approach into the bundles_to_dataframe() method call.\nUse FHIRPath to select specific elements and map them onto column names.\n\nThe second approach is typically more concise. For example, to generate a DataFrame like this…\n\n\n\nid\ngender\ndate_of_birth\nmarital_status\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n…you could use the following code:\n\n# Instantiate and perform the FHIR search interaction in a single function call\ndf = search.steal_bundles_to_dataframe(\n    resource_type=\"Patient\",\n    request_params={\n        \"_count\": 10,  # Get 10 instances per page\n    },\n    num_pages=1,  # Get 1 page (so a total of 10 instances)\n    fhir_paths=[\n        (\"id\", \"identifier[0].value\"),\n        (\"gender\", \"gender\"),\n        (\"date_of_birth\", \"birthDate\"),\n        (\"marital_status\", \"maritalStatus.coding[0].code\"),\n    ],\n)\ndf\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient?_count=10\n\n\nQuery & Build DF (Patient):   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]Query & Build DF (Patient): 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 163.89it/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ngender\ndate_of_birth\nmarital_status\n\n\n\n\n0\n837e80f6-a7a5-77f8-36aa-c7b8ff002c4b\nmale\n1922-11-05\nS\n\n\n1\n39533e4a-f6f2-a144-ab37-6500460250dc\nmale\n1919-01-28\nM\n\n\n2\n68c3ae0b-e298-62b7-5d3a-7936fd998fe0\nmale\n1919-01-28\nM\n\n\n3\ndf860bc2-1943-237f-7445-ed960a1ef069\nmale\n1921-11-21\nS\n\n\n4\n7d9ba758-f0b8-3fc3-befa-f0e8e8fb6935\nmale\n1921-07-29\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 4: Validation: Column Selection\n\n\n\n\n\nYour code is working correctly if:\n\nDataFrame contains only the specified columns\nColumn names match your defined mappings\nData types are appropriate (e.g., dates for birthDate)\nNo errors in FHIRPath expressions\n\n\n\n\nWhile FHIRPath can be quite complex, its use in FHIR-PYrate is often straightforward. Nested elements are separated with ., and elements with multiple sub-values are identified by [N] where N is an integer starting at 0.\nExamples illustrating the relationship between FHIRPath and DataFrame column names:\n\nWhen using FHIRPath, maritalStatus.coding[0].code refers to the same data that appears in the column named maritalStatus_coding_0_code in the full DataFrame output. The [0] indicates it’s the first coding in the maritalStatus array.\nSimilarly, in the DataFrame output we saw a column identifier_3_type_coding_0_system which corresponds to the FHIRPath expression identifier[3].type.coding[0].system. This refers to the system identifier for the type of the fourth identifier (arrays are zero-indexed).\n\nThe element paths can typically be constructed by looking at the hierarchy resource pages in the FHIR specification, or by examining the column names in a full DataFrame output and converting the underscore notation to FHIRPath notation.\nSee Key FHIR Resources for more information on reading the FHIR specification.",

This allows you to retrieve related resources in a single API call.\nSee Using the FHIR API to Access Data for more information on constructing the parameters for FHIR search interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 1: Azure FHIR API Limits\n\n\n\nAzure FHIR API limits _include and _revinclude parameters to 100 items.

    "text": "Manual setup on an existing server\n\nInstall JupyterHub\nFollowing the relevant portion of these instructions, run the following after SSHing into the Ubuntu VM:\nsudo apt install python3 python3-dev git curl\ncurl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py | sudo -E python3 - --admin jupyterhub --show-progress-page --plugin git+https://github.com/kafonek/tljh-shared-directory\nThe --show-progress-page option will show a status page at http://&lt;public ip address here&gt;/index.html while the installer is running.\nThe setup should be automatic after running this command. When completed, navigating to http://&lt;public ip address here&gt; in your web browser should show JupyterHub. You log in with username jupyterhub and whatever password you enter in the login box will be set for the jupyterhub account automatically.\n\n\nCreating users for the workshop\nCan batch create, password will be set the first time they log in\nDon’t create extra admins – they have root access to the server.\n\n\nResetting passwords\nDelete the user through the JupyterHub admin console. This will not delete their home folder on the server where their files are stored.\n\n\nDeleting users\nIn addition to deleting a user through the JupyterHub admin console, you will also need to delete their Linux account:\nsudo userdel jupyter-usernamegoeshere\n\n\nCreate shared data folders\nThe tljh-shared-directory will create a scratch folder that all JupyterHub users will be able to read/write to. However, only the user that creates a file will be able to edit it.\nYou can also create a read-only folder for all users:\nsudo mkdir -p /srv/workshop\ncd /etc/skel\nsudo ln -s /srv/workshop workshop-read-only\nAll new users created after you run the above commands will have a workshop-read-only/ folder symlink in their home folder.\n\n\nGetting the Jupyter notebook and installing dependencies\nCreate a new Terminal window in JupyterHub while logged in as an admin, and run the following command:\ngit clone https://github.com/NIH-ODSS/fhir-for-research.git\nsudo -E pip install -r /path/to/fhir-for-research/requirements.txt\nThe requirements.txt file you need is here if you can’t easily access your clone of the repo.\n\n\nGetting the notebook in every user’s home folder\nThere are two options:\n\nCopy the notebook to /etc/skel, and JupyterHub will automatically copy it to the home folder for every new user. This is easier for the users, but there is no good way to update notebook contents once a user account has been created.\nPut it in the /srv/workshop folder, and have users open it via JupyterHub, “save as”, and then refresh the page. This is more cumbersome for the users, but ensures everyone will have an up-to-date notebook to work off of.\n\n\n\nAvoiding time-outs\nSee Culling idle notebook servers — The Littlest JupyterHub documentation:\nsudo tljh-config set services.cull.timeout 18000 # 5 hours\nsudo tljh-config reload\n\n\nConverting JWK to PEM\nsudo apt install nodejs npm\nnpm install node-jose\nCreate convert.js with the following contents:\nconst jose = require(\"node-jose\");\n\nconst jwks = {}; // Set this to the full JWKS from https://bulk-data.smarthealthit.org\n\n// Get first key where the `key_ops` value is `sign` -- this is the private key\nconst key = jwks[\"keys\"].filter((k) =&gt; k.key_ops[0] == \"sign\")[0];\n\n// Convert private key to PEM format and print to terminal\njose.JWK.asKey(key).then(function (key) {\n  console.log(key.toPEM(true));\n});\nNow you can run node convert.js to get the private key in PEM format.\n\n\nCreating synthea.ndjson\n\nDownload the 1k FHIR R4 sample dataset from here\nUnzip and delete down to the number of patients you want (recommended: 50 or 100)\nRun jq -c '.entry[].resource' *.json &gt; synthea.ndjson (this requires jq)\n\nPlace the .ndjson file(s) in /etc/skel on the server to add them automatically to each new user’s home folder.\n\n\nEnable TOC in Jupyter\nFrom the Terminal window via a JupyterHub admin account:\nsudo -E pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\nsudo -E jupyter contrib nbextension install --sys-prefix\nsudo -E jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main --sys-prefix\nThis is based on this documentation"

    "text": "Capability assessments\nA capability assessment is a structured approach for identifying the current level of understanding and skill sets relating to a topic. This approach was used to inform the content in the self-paced learning resources, webinars, and workshops on this site.\nA capability assessment may help you adapt existing content to meet the needs and interests of your target audience.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSelect a representative sample of people to connect with. Bear in mind that current FHIR capabilities and future needs may differ substantially across organizations.\nSimilarly, including a variety of roles in the assessment will ensure that content can support different needs. It may be helpful to connect with people that hold the following roles to build a well-rounded picture of what the capabilities and needs in a FHIR for Research workshop:\n\nInvestigators/Researchers\nResearch leaders\nInformaticists\nSoftware Engineers\nClinician Scientists/Trainees\n\n(These are the roles we considered when developing the content on this website.)\nUse a variety of outreach methods. The capability assessment that informed this website used unstructured listening sessions and surveys, which allowed us to capture perspectives from different roles across multiple organizations.\nAdapt existing content in response to the observations. Throughout the outreach process, identify common themes and observations from your discussions, surveys, and/or listening sessions. Based on the observations, consider adapting the existing workshops to fit the needs of your group of researchers. Examples of useful adaptations may include:\n\nIdentifying relevant FHIR resources to export in the FHIR Bulk Data workshop based on local researcher needs and EHR capabilities.\nAggregate specific data elements in the SMART on FHIR Applications workshop that are relevant to research topics.\n\nMeet participants at their level of interest and engagement. Not all training participants will need the same level of knowledge about FHIR, or other technology used to work with FHIR APIs and data.\nNote that the existing content on this website was designed to be approachable for people with all levels of technical expertise. Content is generally organized from least-to-most technically complex to provide an “on ramp” for a less experienced audience. However, modifications may need to be made to tailor to your specific audience.\n\n\n\nGetting started with a capability assessment\nWe used roughly the following steps for the capability assessment that informed this website:\n\nIdentify interviewees\nSet-up meetings with interviewees\nWrite survey questions if using a written format or structured interview. The capability assessment questions used for developing this course content are available as a guide\nHold conversations with previously identified interviewees\nAggregate observations from conversations\nReach back to interviewees with follow-up questions if necessary\nAdapt existing resources to support the technical needs and research interests identified in the prior conversations and surveys",

    "section": "Course development",
    "text": "Course development\nUsing an instructional design framework may be useful when developing new modules or workshops. The ADDIE framework (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) is a commonly used cyclical model for instructional design and educational program development. It consists of five stages:\n\nAnalysis: Assess what the target audience already knows about a specific topic, their experience with the subject, and what resources are available.\n\nSee above for recommendations on conducting a capability assessment\n\nDesign: Create learning objectives.\nDevelopment: Create course content that reflects the learning objectives. This should be an iterative process that incorporates regular feedback from learners and instructors.\n\nBloom’s Taxonomy may be useful in constructing learning objectives\n\nImplementation: Determine where the course will be held, in what format, what materials will be needed, and how they will be used.\nEvaluation: Use the learning objectives from the second stage to evaluate the course. Consider assessing participant satisfaction, learning, and performance when comparing the learning objectives to the outcomes.\n\nFollowing an instructional design framework like ADDIE can support the following best practices identified from our workshop development and implementation:\n\nTailor technical prerequisites to the anticipated audience. For example, our SMART on FHIR workshop requires basic HTML and JavaScript experience for hands-on participation. Using a capability assessment can provide valuable information on the existing experience of your audience.\nProvide an “on ramp” introducing the topic at the beginning so less technical participants can still get value from the beginning, as mentioned above. For example, we included an introductory webinar at the beginning of our FHIR Bulk Data workshop.\nIf you design live events to allow for less technical members to leave before getting into more technical content, it’s helpful to clearly identify the “drop points” where people who are not interested in the technical content can safely leave.\nProvide a walk-through to introduce hands-on participation. This can be in the form of reviewing sample code or filling in a template live.\nProvide a way for participants to ask questions if you are asking participants to do hands-on technical work (e.g., writing Python code to call a FHIR API). This could be in the form of an optional “lab” at the end of a workshop where participants can ask questions, or a point of contact for questions after the fact.\nParticipants may also need to ask questions about getting their environment set up. Strategize to reduce setup as much as possible (e.g., use cloud Jupyter environment rather than requiring participants to run it locally – more on this below). Having a brief “preflight” immediately before the hands-on portion of the workshop is also advisable. (Example preflight slide from the FHIR Bulk Data workshop.)\nTo avoid individual-specific questions disrupting the workshop, it is advisable to have an additional person to serve as a “TA”. For virtual workshops, enable a breakout room that the TA can use to help participants 1:1 or in a small group.\n\n\nWorkshop length\nBased on our experience, we recommend keeping the total length of a workshop under 3 hours per day. Having a longer workshop may introduce scheduling difficulties that can suppress attendance, and fatigue may result in diminishing returns for participants. Consider 1-2 hours of content, and an optional “lab” hour if there is substantial hands-on content to allow participants to work independently and ask questions. Include 5 minute breaks every hour.\n\n\nRegistration\nWe recommend requiring registration to attend workshops. This allows for monitoring and adjustment of outreach strategy if the desired mix of people don’t initially sign up. Registration should start at least 2 weeks ahead of the event, and ideally should start even earlier for a longer event that may require participants to shift their usual schedule to attend.\nRegistration should clearly identify prerequisites, required technical skills, and if there is an introductory portion appropriate for all audiences followed by a more technical portion.\nConsider whether your registration form should allow for participants to request reasonable accommodations for disabilities. (This may be required by your organization.)\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe following recommendations support enhanced accessibility of workshop materials:\n\nUse Zoom local recording (or similar) to record screen and audio\nShare recording with subtitles for accessibility\n\nModern transcription applications like MacWhisper can generate subtitles that are quite accurate, requiring fairly minimal manual editing\nSubtitles can be in a .srt “sidecar” file – this is a plain text file that can be easily edited by hand\n\nProvide slides and other materials on a single website at the time of the event\n\ne.g., https://purl.org/fhir-for-research/workshops/bulk-data\nConsider “upstreaming” any materials to the main open source GitHub repository; see [../../contribute.qmd] for more information\n\nUse URLs in slides that can be updated later if the website changes (e.g. from https://purl.org) to avoid broken links in video recordings",

This persona may include roles like CTR PIs, Institute directors, or health system executives like Chief Scientific Officers or Chief Research Informatics Officers.\nInformaticist A technical role primarily responsible for working hands-on with clinical data. This role involve elements of software engineering, but is not focused primarily on developing software. Deep familiarity with clinical data and databases can be assumed, but there may be heterogeneous experience with FHIR and related technology.\nSoftware Engineer A technical role involved in developing software for clinically-focused research. This role may have some hands-on experience with FHIR and related technology, but likely does not have comprehensive knowledge of the space. This role differs from the “Informaticist” in that it focuses on creating software, rather than on data modeling and manipulation.\nClinician Scientist/Trainee A role for practicing clinicians or clinician-trainees. This role is involved with research as a clinical subject matter expert or co-investigator, but is not be responsible for an entire study (or they would be in the “Investigator” role). Their role in research is focused on the clinical aspects related to their area of expertise, and could involve activities like chart review, creating a “phenotyping strategy” to identify a condition using EHR data, or designing a patient- or provider-facing intervention.\nTrainer This role is responsible for leading future researcher-led trainings. People in this role are likely hands-on technical, or technical leaders. There may be overlap with the “Informaticist” and “Software Engineer” roles."

    "text": "3 Selecting specific columns\nUsually not every single value from a FHIR instance is needed for analysis. There are two ways to get a more concise data frame:\n\nUse the approach above to load all elements into a data frame, remove the unneeded columns, and rename the remaining columns as needed.\nUse XPath to select specific elements and map them onto column names.\n\nThe second approach is typically more concise. For example, to generate a DataFrame like this…\n\n\n\nid\ngender\ndate_of_birth\nmarital_status\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n…you could use the following code:\n\ntable_desc_patient &lt;- fhir_table_description(\n    resource = \"Patient\",\n    cols = c(\n        id = \"id\",\n        gender = \"gender\",\n        date_of_birth = \"birthDate\",\n        # Rather than having fhircrackr concatenate all `Patient.maritalStatus` values\n        # into one cell, you can select a specific value with XPath:\n        marital_status = \"maritalStatus/coding/code\"\n    )\n)\n\ndf_patient &lt;- fhir_crack(bundles = patient_bundle, design = table_desc_patient, verbose = 0)\n\ndf_patient %&gt;% head(5)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhile XPath expressions can be quite complex, thier use in fhircrackr is often straight-forward. Nested elements are separated with /, and elements with multiple sub-values are identified by [N] where N is an integer starting at 1.\nThere are two approaches to identifying element paths to construct XPath expressions:\n\nLook at the FHIR specification or the relevant FHIR Implementation Guide to determine the paths of available data elements. For example, the Patient page in the FHIR specification describes the elements and their hierarchy for instances of Patient.\nPrint out the raw data returned by the FHIR server. Fhircrackr uses XML-formatted data, and the following code will print out one of the instances of Patient requested above:\n\n\nxml2::xml_find_first(x = patient_bundle[[1]], xpath = \"./entry[1]/resource\") %&gt;%\n    paste0() %&gt;%\n    cat()\n\n&lt;resource&gt;\n  &lt;Patient&gt;\n    &lt;id value=\"258974\"/&gt;\n    &lt;meta&gt;\n      &lt;versionId value=\"4\"/&gt;\n

For example, if you want to include the synthetic “Social Security Number” in the original data:\n\ndf_patient %&gt;%\n    # Add in row numbers for joining\n    mutate(\n        row_number = row_number()\n    ) %&gt;%\n    left_join(\n        df_patient_identifiers %&gt;%\n            # Note: this assumes there is just one social security number for each patient in the data.\n            # If this was not true, it would be necessary to remove extra data before joining so there\n            # was one row per patient.\n            filter(`identifier.type.text` == \"Social Security Number\") %&gt;%\n            rename(\n                \"ssn\" = \"identifier.value\"\n            ) %&gt;%\n            # Exclude the `identifier.type.text` column so it doesn't appear in the joined data frame\n            select(resource_identifier, ssn) %&gt;%\n            # Fhircrackr generates the `resource_identifier` column as a string, but it needs to be\n            # an integer for joining.\n            mutate(resource_identifier = as.integer(resource_identifier)),\n        by = c(\"row_number\" = \"resource_identifier\")\n    ) %&gt;%\n    head(5)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYou can see that the synthetic SSNs are now split out into a separate column."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Researchers who want to analyze FHIR-formatted data will typically need to convert data from FHIR format into a table-based format that can be used directly in analysis environments like Python, R, SAS, or Stata. Data analysis in these environments typically requires tidy data:\nFHIR’s data format does not meet this definition of “tidy.” While instances of FHIR resources do typically map onto observational units, the data contained within instances of FHIR resources are not “flat” – instead, data are stored in nested data structures. In some cases, like Observation.component, there may even be multiple “observational units” inside of a single FHIR resource instance.\nFortunately, FHIR’s computable JSON or XML data format makes it possible to use software to convert FHIR data into a tabular format. This is can be done with custom code, or via existing purpose-build libraries.\nThere are purpose-built libraries for Python and R that facilitate FHIR-to-tabular conversion:\nA technical introduction to using these libraries with synthetic FHIR-format data is provided in Using Python and Using R. The approach described in these modules can typically be performed by an informaticist, analyst, or statistician who is familiar with one of these environments and has reviewed the content on this website."

For example, SAS can read JSON via the JSON engine and XML via this method. Stata can read JSON via a third-party library or using its integration with Python. Other approaches like using an ODBC driver may also work.\nHowever, it may be simpler to use Python or R to convert FHIR-formatted data to tabular, and then import this into your analysis tool of choice. This can be done via Pandas in Python or the foreign package in R."

It is a good test server to begin with, and meets most testing needs with the least amount of friction to get started. There are other options for those interested in exploring further though, which are covered both on the HL7 list of public test servers and in Other Server Options.\n\nHAPI FHIR Reference Server\n\nWeb UI: http://hapi.fhir.org\nDSTU2 Endpoint: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu2\nSTU3 Endpoint: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseDstu3\nR4 Endpoint: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4\nR5 Endpoint: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR5\n\n\nTo quickly pull and run the HAPI FHIR server on port 8080, make sure Docker is running, and then run the following:\ndocker pull hapiproject/hapi:latest\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest\nWait until the logging output shows Started Application in ___ seconds and you will have a FHIR server running with a base URL of http://localhost:8080/fhir.

    "section": "1.2 Other Server Options",
    "text": "1.2 Other Server Options\nIf the HAPI FHIR server does meet your testing needs, there are a few options: Docker-based servers, Logica Sandbox Community Edition, and MELD.\n\n1.2.1 Docker-based servers\nDocker is a tool that runs packaged software locally. Packaging software to run on Docker means it can be preconfigured with all necessary dependencies, allowing it to run on nearly any hardware and operating system. This differs from traditional software, which often requires separate builds or development for Windows and Mac, may need additional libraries to be installed beforehand, and can involve a complicated setup process. Docker is commonly used for running servers.\nWhile Docker-based options generally require some configuration, especially when you want your test data to persist after you reboot, they can be setup quickly without programming experience. Although, Git is required for several Docker-based options.\nDetailed technical documentation on Docker is available at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/. To get started, Docker offers step-by-step instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/. (Note that Docker Desktop is generally not free for organizations and professional use. There are free alternatives however they require more manual effort to get everything working. Setting up an alternative to Docker is outside the scope of this page.)\nIf you intend to run research on a server that is not based on HAPI, below are a few setup guides for Docker-based FHIR server implementations:\n\nMicrosoft/Azure FHIR Server\nLinuxForHealth FHIR Server (formerly IBM)\nBlueHalo FHIR Server (formerly Asymmetrik)\nfhir-candle, which is a small, in-memory FHIR server meant for testing and development (not production use cases)\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Logica Sandbox Community Edition\nA cloud service, like Logica Sandbox Community Edition can be a low-friction option to get started—no installation is required on your local computer. Additional benefits include free registration, a shareable common instance between multiple people, and persistence across computer restarts. The Sandbox Community Edition can be run using Docker, but due to the number of individual services needed, using it requires a non-trivial amount of setup and knowledge of Docker.\nQuick Start Make sure Docker is running, then clone the project, change to the directory, and launch the services with the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/logicahealth/sandbox-community-edition.git\ncd sandbox-community-edition\ndocker compose up\nLaunching the services will take a while the first time as it needs to download the Docker images. Wait until the logging output stops, then open the sandbox at http://sandbox:3001. From here the steps are identical to the steps for the cloud service steps listed above.\nFull instructions are available at https://github.com/logicahealth/sandbox-community-edition.\n\n\n1.2.3 MELD\nMELD is a hosted service, similar to the Logica FHIR Sandbox, offered by InterOp Community. It is available at https://meld.interop.community.\nRelying on any free hosted service has a few downsides: you are dependent on the service staying online and providing appropriate security to make sure your data is accessible to you and only to you. Real health data and synthetic data containing alterations you want to keep private should never be uploaded to an online sandbox service. Anything stored in an online sandbox should also have a local backup copy, just in case.\nThere are no published limits to the software in terms of the number of Patients, number of Resources, physical size, or bandwidth usage. However, we recommend keeping your population as small as possible—both in terms of number of patients and the total amount of data per patient—to ensure good performance. Uploading files larger than roughly 2 MB may cause timeouts. If a timeout occurs while uploading a file, wait a few minutes for it to finish processing before trying again. The server will throw an error if you try to upload a second patient while one is already processing.\nMELD Signup Steps\nTo create your own MELD Sandbox, first register at https://meld.interop.community. You will need to provide an email address, where you will receive a confirmation email which you should click to activate your new account. Sign in using your email and password and accept the terms of use.\nNow you can create a new sandbox by clicking the New Sandbox button. The creation screen is shown below.\n\nChoose a name, ID, and FHIR version that are appropriate for your usage. We recommend enabling the, “Allow Open FHIR Endpoint” setting as this will make it easier to load an initial set of data, and it may be disabled later for security.\nIf you plan to load patients for a specific use case, you may want to disable the, “Import sample patients and practitioners” option to ensure only your selected patients are loaded. Feel free to select or deselect the sample applications option - it will have no impact on basic FHIR operations.\nAfter clicking create, it will take ~15 seconds to setup the instance. Once ready, click on the row to go to the dashboard for your server. You can then visit the Settings tab to see your “Open FHIR Server URL.” This is the server base URL that should be used for loading patients in the Loading Synthea Patients section below. If you want to require security on the server, once you have loaded all the patients you want, return to this Settings tab and click the pencil icon to edit, and uncheck, “Allow Open FHIR Endpoint.”",

    "section": "2 Generic Modules",
    "text": "2 Generic Modules\nAt Synthea’s core is a set of disease modules, representing the progression and treatment of various conditions. Below is a small snippet of the Appendicitis module.\n\nDisease modules are state transition machines where each individual flows through the modules based on logical conditions and weighted randomness. Behind the scenes, modules are stored as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, but nearly all users view or edit modules exclusively using a graphical interface called the Synthea Module Builder.\nEvery synthetic patient starts in each module’s Initial state at birth and immediately begins progressing through the module’s states. There are two broad categories of states, control states and clinical states.\nControl states drive the flow of a patient through the module. For example:\n\nDelay: Wait a certain amount of time before progressing, commonly used to represent how the risk of certain conditions changes with age.\nGuard: Wait until given criteria become true before progressing.\n\nClinical states add entries to a patient’s health record. For example:\n\nConditionOnset: Represents the point where the patient acquires a given condition, not necessarily where it is diagnosed.\nProcedure: Represents the point in time in a healthcare encounter that a procedure is performed.\n\nFor a full list of state types, see the Synthea wiki.\nEach state has a transition, which points to the state the patient will progress to next:\n\nDirect transitions: Point to a single state.\nDistributed transitions: Point to multiple states, each with a weighted probability. A patient progresses to a randomly chosen state.\nConditional transitions: Include logical rules showing which path to follow.\nComplex transitions: Are a combination of conditional and distributed transitions.\n\nModules will run until either the simulation ends (at patient death or when it reaches the current date) or until the module reaches a Terminal state. Terminal here means “the end of this module”, not “the patient has a terminal condition and died”. For instance, the Appendicitis module terminates after the patient has an appendectomy. Compare to the Sore Throat module which does not have a Terminal state since people are always at risk of common viral conditions that present as sore throat.\nCombining these simple concepts allows module developers to build robust and detailed models of disease progression and treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on Synthea clinical detail\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Synthea is open source and accepts contributions from a global user base, the level of detail varies across modules. For instance, the Appendicitis module was the first to be created, and the level of detail is minimal. On the other hand, the COVID-19 module and submodules were designed to replicate the disease’s progression as closely as possible, and is probably the largest and most detailed module.\nFurther, the number of disease modules is limited. Early efforts focused on the “top ten” causes of premature death and reasons people see their primary care provider. Further additions have added a large number of modules representing common conditions, but rarer and more complex conditions may not be represented.\nThe Synthea community encourages and welcomes users to create new modules representing conditions of interest or to improve the detail and realism of existing modules.\n\n\n\nYou can view, modify, and create Synthea modules with no programming experience using the Synthea Module Builder. For more information, read Customizing Synthea. There is also a short video introduction to the Module Builder, and a tutorial on the Synthea Wiki.",

If you require fields that Synthea doesn’t populate, you can customize Synthea to add those fields. Read Customizing Synthea for more information.\nBy default, Synthea exports one file per patient, as a Bundle with type: transaction. This Bundle contains a single Patient resource as the first entry, followed by other patient-specific resources such as Conditions, Observations, Procedures, etc, roughly grouped by Encounter in chronological order. Synthea exports Organizations and Practitioners separately since these resources may be referenced by multiple patients’ resources. Synthea may also be configured to export FHIR Bulk Data.\nAs of January 2025, Synthea can produce the following resource types:\n\nAllergyIntolerance\nBundle\nCarePlan\nCareTeam\nClaim\nCondition\nCoverage\nDevice\nDiagnosticReport\nDocumentReference\nEncounter\nExplanationOfBenefit\nGoal\nImagingStudy\nImmunization\nLocation\nMedication\nMedicationRequest\nMedicationAdministration\nObservation\nOrganization\nPatient\nPractitioner\nPractitionerRole\nProcedure\nProvenance\n\nNote that not all patient records will contain instances of every resource type, and certain resource types will only be produced if certain settings are enabled.

    "text": "1 High-level technical considerations\n\n1.1 Authorization pattern\nAuthorization ensures that the user of an application has permission to perform specific actions. For SMART-on-FHIR applications, it ensures the user is allowed to access the FHIR data they are requesting.\nYour SMART on FHIR application will use one of the authorization patterns defined by the SMART App Launch specification.\n\nSMART App Launch supports applications that launch in an EHR or launch standalone:\n\nEHR Launch: A user launches the application within the EHR from an existing EHR session (e.g., custom a clinical decision support application).\nStandalone Launch: A user launches the application directly, like in a smartphone or stand-alone website (e.g., Apple’s Health app on the iPhone).\n\nSMART Backend Services support applications that run autonomously, like an automated data pipeline. SMART Backend Services are also used for user-facing applications where the FHIR authorization service does not need the user’s information (e.g., a dashboard application).\n\n\n\n1.2 Software libraries\nOpen-source libraries exist in many programming languages to help developers work with FHIR data and SMART App Launch.\ndocs.smarthealthit.org lists the following software libraries that support SMART App Launch:\n\n\nJavaScript or TypeScript: Client-side and server-side library with support for SMART App Launch\nNode.js from Vermonster: An alternative Node.js implementation\nPython: Server-side Python library with support for SMART App Launch\nR\nRuby\nSwift (iOS)\nJava\n.NET: FHIR client library from Firely\n\n\nHL7®’s Confluence site also has a list of FHIR-related software libraries.\nYou can create a SMART on FHIR application without relying on third-party libraries, but using a third-party library will likely save development time.\n\n\n1.3 Security and privacy\nFHIR servers will likely return health data that can be linked to an individual. If so, rules around handling Protected Health Information (PHI) apply. Your institution’s IRB will also have policies for handling sensitive patient data used in research.\nDetermine the security and privacy approach for health data early in your design process before working with any real patient data. You can use synthetic data and a test FHIR server during development and testing.\n\n\n1.4 Human-centered design\nIf you are developing a user-facing application, consider a human-centered design approach. From ISO 9241-210:2019:\n\nHuman-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.\n\nFor more information on human-centered design in healthcare research, see Göttgens and Oertelt-Prigione (2021)."

    "text": "2 Example SMART on FHIR app\nFollow the steps below to create a simple browser-based SMART on FHIR app (based on this tutorial) using JavaScript. This example will use SMART App Launch’s EHR Launch flow.\n\n2.1 Prerequisites\nYou need:\n\na text editor\na way to run a local HTTP server (described below)\nfamiliarity with HTML, JavaScript, and the command line\n\n\n\n2.2 Instructions\nBelow are the instructions for getting an example SMART on FHIR app running locally. We provide a detailed explanation of how this works after the instructions.\n\nStep 1: Create a project folder and files\nCreate a folder with two files:\n\nlaunch.html\nindex.html\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create the launch page\nAdd the following content to launch.html:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Launch My APP&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Use the SMART on FHIR JavaScript library to handle authorization --&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            FHIR.oauth2.authorize({\n\n              // The client_id that you should have obtained after registering a client at\n              // the EHR.\n              //\n              // Note that this can be an arbitrary string when testing with\n              // http://launch.smarthealthit.org.\n              clientId: \"my_web_app\",\n\n              // The scopes that you request from the EHR. In this case we want to:\n              // launch            - Get the launch context\n              // openid & fhirUser - Get the current user\n              // patient/*.read    - Read patient data\n              scope: \"launch openid fhirUser patient/*.read\",\n\n              // Typically, if your redirectUri points to the root of the current directory\n              // (where the launchUri is), you can omit this option because the default value is\n              // \".\". However, some servers do not support directory indexes so \".\" and \"./\"\n              // will not automatically map to the \"index.html\" file in that directory.\n              redirectUri: \"index.html\"\n            });\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nNote that the FHIR.oauth2.authorize() method will automatically redirect back to the authorization server (launch.smarthealthit.org for this example). This means that you will never see this page rendered in your browser.\n\n\nStep 3: Create the “app” page\nAdd the following contents to index.html. This will be the testing “app” for this example:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Example SMART App&lt;/title&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use the SMART on FHIR JavaScript library --&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use Bootstrap for styling --&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;\n            /* Additional styling for text boxes that will show JSON data */\n            #patient, #meds {\n                font-family: Monaco, monospace;\n                white-space: pre;\n                font-size: 13px;\n                height: 38vh;\n                overflow: scroll;\n                border: 1px solid #CCC;\n            }\n        &lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;nav class=\"navbar bg-primary\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2vh\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"navbar-brand mb-0 h1 text-white\"&gt;Example SMART on FHIR Application&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/nav&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Current Patient&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"patient\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;br/&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Medications&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"meds\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n                FHIR.oauth2.ready().then(function(client) {\n\n                    // Render the current patient (or any error)\n                    client.patient.read().then(\n                        function(pt) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = JSON.stringify(pt, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n\n                    // Get MedicationRequests for the selected patient\n                    client.request(\"/MedicationRequest?patient=\" + client.patient.id, {\n                        resolveReferences: [ \"medicationReference\" ],\n                        graph: true\n                    })\n\n                    // Reject if no MedicationRequests are found\n                    .then(function(data) {\n                        if (!data.entry || !data.entry.length) {\n                            throw new Error(\"No medications found for the selected patient\");\n                        }\n                        return data.entry;\n                    })\n\n\n                    // Render the current patient's medications (or any error)\n                    .then(\n                        function(meds) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = JSON.stringify(meds, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n\n                }).catch(console.error);\n            &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\nStep 4: Run a local web server\n\nOpen a command prompt window and go to the folder you created.\nRun a command to start a local web server on port 8000. For example, if you have Python 3 on your system run:\npython3 -m http.server 8000\nFor Python 2, run:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nFor more information on using Python as a local web server, review Mozilla’s test server guide. If you don’t have Python, you can use Ruby or a Node package.\nOnce you are running the server, navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see a page that looks like this:\n\nNote: data will not load by opening index.html in your browser. To load data, you must go through the EHR launch flow (see next step).\n\n\nStep 5: Test with launch.smarthealthit.org\nGo to https://launch.smarthealthit.org, enter http://localhost:8000/launch.html for in the “App’s Launch URL” field, and click “Launch”.\nYou should see the following happen:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n2.3 App launch process explanation\nHere’s a visual diagram of the process that occurs when you launch your example application with launch.smarthealthit.org:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    accTitle: Diagram showing the workflow for a SMART on FHIR EHR launch\n    %%{init:{'sequence':{'messageFontSize': 30, 'actorFontSize': 30}}}%%\n    participant A as localhost:8000/launch.html\n    participant B as launch.smarthealthit.org\n    participant C as localhost:8000/index.html\n    participant D as FHIR Server\n\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Launch triggered via test website\n    B -&gt;&gt; A: Launch requested\n    A -&gt;&gt; B: Authorization request\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Dummy provider log-in and patient selection\n    B -&gt;&gt; C: Authorization granted\n    C -&gt;&gt; B: Access token request\n    B --&gt;&gt; C: Access token response\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request Patient\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with Patient JSON\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request MedicationRequests\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with MedicationRequest JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the details of this process:\n\nYou trigger the application launch by clicking “Launch” on launch.smarthealthit.org. This simulates an EHR user triggering a SMART on FHIR app launch using a link in the EHR.\nIn this case, launch.smarthealthit.org redirects your browser to http://localhost:8000/launch.html?iss=http%3A%2F%2Flaunch.smarthealthit.org%2Fv%2Fr4%2Ffhir&launch=....\nThe SMART App Launch documentation explains the two parameters in this URL:\n\n\niss: Identifies the EHR’s FHIR endpoint, which the app can use to obtain additional details about the EHR including its authorization URL.\nlaunch: Opaque identifier for this specific launch and any EHR context associated with it. This parameter must be communicated back to the EHR at authorization time.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/launch.html loads in your browser, and FHIR.oauth2.authorize() is called with the options defined in launch.html’s source code. The authorize() method obtains an authorization code from the testing server’s “authorize” endpoint. In this case, it does this by triggering a browser redirect to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/authorize with a number of parameters.\nYour browser loads a page on the launch.smarthealthit.org server simulating provider log-in and patient selection. (Note: If this application was being used in a real-world EHR, the provider would be logged in through the EHR and the selected patient would be whichever patient the provider was viewing when they launched the app in the EHR.)\nThis dummy flow gathers the information needed for launch.smarthealthit.org to provide the example application with the authorization code. It does this by redirecting your browser to http://localhost:8000/index.html?code=...&state=.... It knows to take you to http://localhost:8000/index.html because you specified the parameter redirectUri: \"index.html\" in the source code of launch.html.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html loads in your browser and calls FHIR.oauth2.ready(). This creates a Client instance that handles obtaining and refreshing the OAuth access token needed to authorize access to the FHIR server, and making requests to the FHIR server with the proper headers.\nIn this case, a call is made to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/token, which responds with the authorization token that must be passed along with any requests for FHIR data.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.patient.read() to request the Patient resource instance from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/Patient/39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the read() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.request(...) to request the MedicationRequest resource instances from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/MedicationRequest?patient=39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the request() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\n\nNow that the application has access to FHIR data, common front-end web development techniques could be used to create an application that utilizes this data.\nThis example assumes a SMART on FHIR-enabled server (like the https://launch.smarthealthit.org testing server used above). See this tutorial for more information on setting up a SMART on FHIR-enabled server.\nAdditionally, Cerner’s browser-based app tutorial provides more detail on setting up a browser-based SMART on FHIR application."

    "section": "Use cases",
    "text": "Use cases\nCommon research uses of REDCap include:\n\nCollecting self-reported survey data from study participants (patients or providers)\nDigital capture and storage of informed consent documents\nEntering, storing, and querying clinical information, like for a disease registry (for example, see Metke-Jimenez and Hansen (2019) below or @shalhout2022) or a vaccine status tracker (see Lenert et al. (2023) described below)\nCase report forms (for example, see Cheng et al. (2023) below)\nChart abstraction (for example, see Mayer et al. (2022))\n\nA more detailed look at example use cases follows.\n\nExample use case: vaccine status tracker\nLenert et al. (2023) tested a population-level vaccination status tracker, called VACtrac, using a combination of two approaches:\n\nA FHIR-compatible copy of the existing statewide Immunization Information System (IIS), with a REDCap data warehouse\nA REDCap health management program with a list of patients for providers to maintain communication with and update vaccination status records, either through a Bulk FHIR update or one-time query.\n\nVACtrac uses REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) FHIR plug-in for both Epic and Cerner EHRs to extract patient information. The REDCap database can be accessed and updated by multiple providers, so the burden of maintaining vaccination information can be spread among multiple providers.\nThe REDCap vaccination status tracker is publicly available for adaption in other institutions.\n\n\nExample use case: cancer registry\nMetke-Jimenez and Hansen (2019) implemented FHIRCap, a transformation engine, to translate data in a REDCap project to FHIR resources. The authors tested FHIRCap on an existing REDCap form and database for a cancer registry. They were able to transform the information from REDCap to FHIR resources and then map the codes to SNOMED CT. While the process was manual and time intensive to set up, the rules only have to be written once for a project and can be used as long as the REDCap form doesn’t change.\n\n\nExample use case: case report forms\nCheng et al. (2023) describe how REDCap can be used to collect electronic case report forms, and how data elements on these forms may be populated automatically using REDCap’s integration with FHIR. Automatic population of these forms has the potential to increase accuracy and decrease the burden of manual data entry.\nNote that it is also possible to extract data from an EHR or other clinical system without FHIR, and load this into REDCap using its import capability.",

This is particularly beneficial for researchers who need to build applications capable of handling diverse and complex data sets, or want to deploy their applications across multiple organizations with different EHR installations.\nDeveloping applications using FHIR involves leveraging its robust set of resources that represent granular clinical concepts, such as patients, admissions, diagnostic reports, and medications. These resources can be combined in various ways to support a wide range of healthcare-related scenarios.\nThe process of FHIR application development often includes utilizing complementary technologies such as SMART on FHIR, CDS Hooks, and Bulk FHIR.\n\nSMART on FHIR provides a framework that allows developers to create secure healthcare applications that can run on any EHR system supporting the FHIR standard.\nCDS Hooks is a standard for integrating clinical decision support (CDS) into EHR workflows, offering real-time, context-sensitive guidance. CDS Hooks can be leveraged to enable clinical EHR workflow triggers to launch SMART on FHIR applications.\nBulk Data Access enables efficient extraction of large datasets for research purposes.\n\nTogether, these technologies empower developers to create innovative, interoperable applications that enhance healthcare delivery and research capabilities."

    "text": "1 Research use cases\n\n1.1 Integrating with an EHR\nResearchers primarily use SMART on FHIR to integrate with an EHR. For example, several researchers have trialed new clinical decision support (CDS) systems using SMART on FHIR. They use SMART on FHIR to integrate their CDS tool into EHRs without modifying the EHRs and without creating unique versions for each EHR vendor.\nTarumi et al. (2021) used this approach to show that an AI-driven CDS could integrate with Epic via SMART on FHIR, and Curran et al. (2020) used this approach to prototype a CDS system for chronic disease management.\n\n\n1.2 Adding data to an EHR workflow\nResearchers also use SMART on FHIR to add data to EHR workflows. For example, a patient may use a web or smartphone app to report their outcomes data. A SMART on FHIR application can make this data accessible from an EHR (Wesley et al. 2021).\nSMART on FHIR can also help researchers integrate data into an EHR that the EHR does not natively support. For example, Watkins and Eilbeck (2020) discuss how genetic testing could be better-integrated with EHRs using SMART on FHIR and CDS Hooks.\n\n\n1.3 Accessing bulk data\nSMART on FHIR facilitated Bulk Data Access (see also: the Bulk Data spec) may provide a new way for researchers to access population-level data. A researcher may want to gather population data from multiple institutions that do not store their data using a shared common data model. However, many EHR installations in the US have implemented the US Core FHIR Implementation Guide, which provides a consistent representation of the USCDI data elements. SMART on FHIR with Bulk Data Access would enable researchers to access the data as US Core-conforming FHIR resource instances across these institutions.\nNote: SMART on FHIR used for Bulk Data Access is relatively new technology and has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed research publications.\n\n\n1.4 SMART on FHIR app gallary\nThe SMART App Gallery lists a number of SMART on FHIR applications, which may provide additional ideas on how SMART on FHIR could be used for research.",

    "text": "3 Implementation considerations\nIf you have a research use case that is a good fit with SMART on FHIR, you will likely work with a software engineer and your institution’s IT experts to investigate integrating with the relevant EHR(s). If your institution has staff with experience integrating SMART on FHIR applications, consult with them early when developing your research approach.\nSMART on FHIR applications that integrate with an EHR’s user interface via SMART App Launch are often web applications. SMART on FHIR applications that run without being triggered by user input in an EHR, including applications that use Bulk Data Access, are often backend services.\nIntegrating SMART on FHIR backend applications with EHRs is often less complex than integrating SMART on FHIR web applications. However, in both cases, there may be EHR-specific requirements including administrative approval.\nAlso, consider security and privacy early when developing your research approach. Take steps to ensure proper data storage and access as you would with any software that handles sensitive data. In addition to IRB approval, you may need approval related to privacy and information security. If your institution has not worked with SMART on FHIR before, it may not have a well-defined process for getting the appropriate approvals. In this case, it may be helpful to identify researchers from other institutions who have used SMART on FHIR in a similar context, and cite their work to demonstrate prior successful use of this technology when discussing with the IRB and decision-makers at your institution.\nPlease see SMART on FHIR Technical Details for more technical implementation on using SMART on FHIR and related standards.",

    "text": "4 Approach & Solution\nAfter ensuring you have access to a test FHIR server with the synthetic data described above, create a web application that responds to the following endpoints:\n\nGET /cds-services, which provides a list of available CDS Service endpoints to the EHR like this:\n{\n  services: [\n    {\n      id: \"retinoblastoma\",\n      hook: \"patient-view\",\n      title: \"Retinoblastoma CDS Service\",\n      description: \"Provides decision support for retinoblastoma cases.\",\n      prefetch: {\n        conditions: \"Condition?patient={{context.patientId}}\",\n        patient: \"Patient/{{context.patientId}}\"\n      }\n    },\n  ],\n}\nMultiple services values can be included if the server supports more than one CDS Service.\nPOST /cds-services/retinoblastoma, which is the CDS Service that runs when the patient-view hook is called.\nThe request body to this endpoint will include information on the hook itself, the context (e.g., the patient’s id for a patient-view hook), and any prefetch data. The CDS Hooks documentation provides an example.\nThis endpoint contains the business logic for the CDS hook. For this use case, this includes identifying when a given patient meets the criteria for displaying the retinoblastoma card: do they have a Condition resource instance with the retinoblastoma SNOMED code (19906005) and meet the age criteria?\nIf the patient meets the criteria, the appropriate card(s) are returned in JSON format. For example:\n[\n  {\n    summary: \"Enrollment Link\",\n    indicator: \"info\",\n    detail:\n      \"This patient is diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Please consider referring them to the retinoblastoma recruitment registry if their parents or guardians are interested in being contacted about research opportunities.\\n\\nClick below to guide the patient’s family through the signing up for the Retinoblastoma Research Recruitment Registry.\",\n    source: {\n      label: \"Enrollment App\",\n    },\n    links: [\n      {\n        label: \"Enroll Patient →\",\n        url: \"http://example.com/enrollment-smart-app\",\n        type: \"smart\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n]\nMultiple cards can be returned if needed. If you want to link to a URL for a non-SMART on FHIR application, use type: \"absolute\" instead of type: \"smart\".\n\nThere are a multitude of approaches for implementing such a server. An example is provided on GitHub implemented using JavaScript. To run the example:\n\nClone the GitHub repository locally.\nUnzip the synthetic_data/cds-retinoblastoma/database-cds-retinoblastoma.zip file and move the enclosed h2.mv.db file into a new folder called hapi_db. This .db file is the pre-loaded database for the HAPI FHIR server that includes the synthetic data for this use case.\nRun the following Docker command to start HAPI with this database:\ndocker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v ${PWD}/hapi_db:/usr/local/tomcat/target/database smartonfhir/hapi-5:r4-empty\nOnce the server has started, you should be able to get a JSON response with this cURL command:\ncurl localhost:8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/Patient/86\nThe output should look like:\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"86\",\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"versionId\": \"1\",\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-09-27T14:14:10.772+00:00\",\n    \"source\": \"#nEQKUSDEs9Q1J8i8\",\n    \"profile\": [ \"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient\" ]\n  },\n  ...\n}\nStart the CDS Service example using the following Docker command:\ncd example_cds_hook_service\ndocker build -t example-cds-hooks-service-image .\ndocker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app example-cds-hooks-service-image\nThis will mount the example_cds_hook_service folder inside the Docker container so any changes to app.js will be reflected immediately. See this README for more information.\nGo to the following URL to launch the CDS Hooks Sandbox using your localhost HAPI server and CDS Service:\nhttps://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/?fhirServiceUrl=http%3A//localhost%3A8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/&serviceDiscoveryURL=http%3A//localhost%3A3000/cds-services&patientId=86\nThe patientId value (86) refers to a synthetic patient who meets the criteria for the retinoblastoma CDS Card described above. You should see the card displayed:\nFor a patient who does not meet the criteria, try this URL:\nhttps://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/?fhirServiceUrl=http%3A//localhost%3A8080/hapi-fhir-jpaserver/fhir/&serviceDiscoveryURL=http%3A//localhost%3A3000/cds-services&patientId=642\nYou should see the CDS Hooks Sandbox without the retinoblastoma card for this patient.",

    "section": "5 Other Research Applications",
    "text": "5 Other Research Applications\nThis use case showcases just a fraction of what CDS Hooks can offer to FHIR research application developers. By leveraging different types of hooks, such as the patient-view used above or hook types like encounter-start hooks, developers can achieve a high degree of flexibility in integrating clinical decision support (CDS) into various points of the clinical workflow. Here are some additional ways CDS Hooks can further enhance research application development:\n\nTailored User Interaction\n\nDynamic Card Content: Implement logic in your CDS service to dynamically generate content on decision support cards based on real-time patient data. For example, if a patient matches the specific eligibility criteria for a clinical trial (e.g., age, diagnosis, comorbidities), the CDS card can display tailored information about the trial, including eligibility requirements, study location, and contact details. This dynamic approach allows for more personalized and contextually relevant prompts, improving the likelihood of clinician engagement.\n\n\n\nEnhancing User Engagement and Feedback\n\nUser Feedback Mechanism: Integrate a mechanism within the CDS cards that allows clinicians to provide feedback directly from the EHR interface. For instance, clinicians can mark whether the decision support was useful, not relevant, or suggest improvements. This feedback loop can be invaluable for iteratively refining the CDS service and enhancing the relevance and accuracy of future interventions. It also fosters a sense of collaboration between the developers and end-users, leading to a more user-centered design.\nTrack Engagement Metrics: Implement analytics to collect data on CDS card interactions, such as display frequency, click-through rates, and subsequent actions taken by clinicians (e.g., initiating a research registry enrollment). By analyzing these engagement metrics, developers can assess the effectiveness of the CDS interventions, identify patterns of use, and make data-driven decisions for optimizing the CDS service. This continuous feedback process ensures that the decision support system evolves to better meet clinician needs and improve patient care.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Considerations for Research Integration\n\nCondition-Specific Hooks: Beyond the patient-view hook, explore the use of condition-specific hooks such as order-select or order-sign hooks. These hooks allow for CDS interventions at the moment of clinical decision-making, such as when a clinician is placing an order for a medication or test. For example, an order-sign hook could be used to prompt a clinician to consider enrolling a patient in a research study before finalizing a treatment order.\nContextual Data Integration: Utilize the context provided by hooks, such as encounter information, patient demographics, and clinical context, to deliver highly specific and actionable CDS interventions. For instance, the encounter-start hook can be used to identify eligible patients for a study based on the reason for their visit, ensuring that research opportunities are presented at the most relevant clinical moments.\n\n\n\nLeveraging FHIR Resources\n\nAdvanced FHIR Queries: CDS services can perform advanced FHIR queries to gather detailed patient information, such as lab results, medication history, and imaging reports. These queries can be used to enrich the decision support content and provide clinicians with a comprehensive view of the patient’s status, enhancing the quality of the CDS intervention.\nPatient-Specific Interventions: Use FHIR resources to tailor interventions based on patient-specific factors, such as genetic markers, social determinants of health, or prior treatment responses. For example, a CDS card could suggest a clinical trial based on a patient’s genetic profile, leveraging FHIR Genomics resources to identify potential matches for precision medicine studies.\n\nBy exploring the capabilities and potential use cases of CDS Hooks, FHIR research application developers can create more sophisticated and effective tools to support clinical research. These tools not only streamline the integration of research into clinical practice but also ensure that patients receive the most current and personalized care options. As you continue to develop and refine your CDS services, keep these considerations in mind to maximize the impact of your clinical decision support and research efforts.",

Use reputable open-source software libraries to save development time and avoid common security pitfalls.\nStrong data protection measures should be employed to safeguard patient information. This includes ensuring patient data exchange complies with relevant regulations to protect sensitive personal health information (PHI). For instance, requirements may include compliance with regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, as well as with your institution’s local Institutional Review Board (IRB) and privacy rules.\nNote that leveraging SMART on FHIR with CDS Hooks can helpful for addressing authorization and authentication.

It is designed to handle large-scale data exports efficiently. The Bulk Data Access standard supports extraction of vast amounts of data (in the form of FHIR resources) in a single request, making it ideal for research, analytics, and population health management.\nThe Bulk Data Access standard is part of the SMART ecosystem, which maintains that developing “plug and play” healthcare applications enables development of “best of breed” digital health solutions, benefiting application developers, care teams, patients, industry, public health and others. Bulk Data Access can be leveraged in conjunction with SMART on FHIR to develop applications that can authenticate and authorize access and facilitate bulk data retrieval automatically.\nAs an HL7® FHIR® standard, Bulk FHIR has been adopted by many electronic health record (EHR) vendors, including Epic, Cerner, Athena Health, and Allscripts.

    "section": "3 Benefits Of Using Bulk FHIR",
    "text": "3 Benefits Of Using Bulk FHIR\nWithout Bulk FHIR, digital health application developers would face significant challenges in handling large-scale patient data transactions. Developing custom solutions to manage these transactions would not only be resource-intensive and time-consuming but also difficult to scale.\nStandard FHIR APIs are designed primarily for retrieving data related to individual patients in real time, typically through a single FHIR resource or a FHIR bundle. Consequently, without Bulk FHIR, accessing longitudinal data across a population or cohort would necessitate a series of repeated FHIR API calls for each individual patient, leading to inefficiencies and increased processing overhead. Bulk FHIR addresses these challenges by enabling the efficient retrieval of large data sets, thus facilitating scalable and streamlined data exchanges.\nKey benefits to using Bulk FHIR for developing FHIR applications that need access to large amounts of electronic health data include:\n\n3.1 Efficient Data Retrieval\n\nScalability: Bulk FHIR is designed for scenarios where large volumes of patient data need to be extracted, processed, or analyzed. It allows for the efficient retrieval of data for multiple patients simultaneously, making it well-suited for population-level analytics and reporting.\nBatch Processing: It supports asynchronous processing, enabling data extraction in batches, which is more efficient than retrieving data individually for each patient. This reduces the burden on servers and minimizes the need for repeated queries.\n\n\n\n3.2 Performance and Speed\n\nReduced API Calls: Instead of making multiple API calls to retrieve data for each patient, Bulk FHIR allows for a single request to fetch data for multiple patients. This significantly improves performance and reduces latency, especially when dealing with large datasets.\nOptimized Data Transfer: Bulk FHIR optimizes data transfer by using more efficient data formats (e.g., NDJSON) and compression, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and processed.\n\n\n\n3.3 Cost-Effectiveness\n\nResource Utilization: By reducing the number of API calls and optimizing data retrieval, Bulk FHIR can lower the computational resources required, leading to cost savings on infrastructure.\nReduced Bandwidth Usage: The optimized data formats and batch processing reduce bandwidth usage, which can result in lower costs for data transfer, especially in cloud-based environments.\n\n\n\n3.4 Compliance and Standardization\n\nInteroperability: Bulk FHIR adheres to the same standardized data models and protocols as individual FHIR resources, ensuring that applications developed using Bulk FHIR remain interoperable with other FHIR-based systems.\nRegulatory Compliance: Using Bulk FHIR supports compliance with regulatory requirements, such as those related to data sharing for population health management and research under the 21st Century Cures Act.\n\n\n\n3.5 Support for Analytics and Research\n\nPopulation Health Management: Bulk FHIR is particularly useful for applications focused on population health management, as it allows for the extraction and analysis of data across large patient cohorts.\nResearch and Quality Improvement: Researchers can leverage Bulk FHIR to access de-identified patient data for research purposes, enabling large-scale studies and quality improvement initiatives.\n\n\n\n3.6 Security and Privacy\n\nGranular Access Control: Bulk FHIR provides mechanisms for managing access to large datasets while adhering to security and privacy standards, including support for OAuth 2.0 for authorization.\n\n\n\n3.7 Future-Proofing\n\nGrowing Support: As Bulk FHIR is increasingly adopted and supported by health systems and EHR vendors, applications developed using this approach are better positioned to be compatible with future data exchange initiatives and regulations.\n\nIn summary, using Bulk FHIR for applications that need to access large amounts of patient data provides significant advantages in terms of efficiency, performance, cost-effectiveness, and support for large-scale analytics and research, making it a preferred choice for developers working with extensive healthcare datasets.",

In their absence, bespoke structural and semantic mappings may be used, which limits reuse and scaling. This is also complicated by the “big data” challenges associated with genomic data due to its breadth and depth: a single human genome ranges from hundreds of megabytes to gigabytes in size, which is larger than most clinical datasets for all patients in a study.",

    "text": "2 HL7 genomics-related FHIR specifications\n\n2.1 FHIR Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (GRIG)\nThe HL7 FHIR Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (GRIG) provides guidance for a standardized representation of genomics data elements leveraging the FHIR framework of resources and operations, optimized for the genomic data exchange for clinical and research-oriented genomic use cases. The GRIG is a HL7 project under the HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup (CGWG).\nThe GRIG is very broad in that it tries to meet both the provider and research needs, covering many aspects of genomics reporting, including:\n\nRepresentation of simple discrete variants, structural variants including copy number variants, complex variants as well as gross variations such as extra or missing chromosomes\nRepresentation of both known variants as well as fully describing de novo variations\nGermline and somatic variations\nRelevance of identified variations from the perspective of disease pathology, pharmacogenomics, transplant suitability (e.g., HLA typing), etc.\nFull and partial DNA sequencing, including whole genome and exome studies\n\nA high-level diagram summarizing the general FHIR genomics constructs in the GRIG is shown below:\n\nAn artifact index summarizes the genomics-related constructs including information modeling diagrams, FHIR profiles, example FHIR resources for each profile, and additional guidance on searching for genomic-related FHIR resources through 1) standard FHIR search parameters, and 2) FHIR operations that are tailored for bioinformatic tasks.\nFHIR genomic operations include but are not limited to:\n\nnormalization services\ndynamic diagnostic or therapeutic implications based on a patient’s variants\nretrieving cohorts of patients with specific variants, phenotypes, genotypes, study metadata\n\nNote: full specification of FHIR genomic operations are in development with a target ballot date in early 2024.\n\n\n2.2 Genomic base FHIR resources\nThe focus of the GRIG is on genomics reporting that mostly occurs after annotation and interpretation in a bioinformatics pipeline. There are however additional research-driven needs for more granular data which merited the release of FHIR base resources. These include:\nMolecularSequence - designed for representing molecular sequences. This resource is not be used for other entities such as variant, variant annotations, genotypes, haplotypes, etc. Those entities will be captured in Observation profiles found in the Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide.\nGenomicStudy - New with FHIR 5.0, the GenomicStudy resource specifies relevant information found in a genomic study, which includes one or more analyses, each serving a specific purpose. These analyses may vary in method (e.g., karyotyping, CNV, or SNV detection), performer, software, devices used, or regions targeted. The use of this resource differs from the Genomics Report profile from the GRIG in that detailed information about the results of the analyses in GenomicStudy may be represented by Observations and gathered in a DiagnosticReport. Both resources may refer back to the originating GenomicStudy to allow navigation.\n\n\n2.3 minimum Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE)\nmCODE is a FHIR specification for a minimal and actionable set of cancer data elements. mCODE includes relevant genomic elements since much of cancer research and care is dependent on genomics for disease discovery and therapeutic decision making.\nThe mCODE standards specifications team works closely with the HL7 CGWG to ensure alignment between mCODE FHIR IG and the GRIG.\n\n\n2.4 Phenopackets\nThe Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopacket standard is not a native FHIR-based standard. Rather it is a lightweight specification that intends to support global exchange of computable case-level phenotypic information for all types of disease diagnosis and research. However, the specification was ported to a GA4GH Phenopacket FHIR Implementation Guide and is currently under development. The Phenopackets designers are working closely with the CCWG to align both standards.\n\n\n2.5 Other genomics-related HL7 specifications\nThere are several additional HL7 specifications that may be relevant:\n\nHL7v2 Laboratory Reporting Interface (LRI)\nThe HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Laboratory Results Interface (LRI) provides guidance on how to communicate laboratory results in general from a (reference) Laboratory’s information system (LIS) to a system interested in receiving and processing lab results (e.g., EHR, Public Health, other Laboratory). It includes a section on sending genetic test results.\nAlthough HL7v2 is considered a legacy data interoperability standard, it is currently the most prevalent means of sending HL7-based structured genetic data from a reference lab to an EHR. Current efforts are underway to address migration strategies from HL7v2 to FHIR-based genomic transport mechanisms.\n\n\nHL7v3 Clinical Document Architecture Family Pedigree\nThe HL7 Clinical Genomics Family Health History (Pedigree) Model is a data standard for exchanging family histories among systems. This includes describing a patient’s full pedigree (family and familial relationships) with diseases and conditions, and the option to link genetic data and risk analysis.\nThe IG was initially released in 2013 and is based on the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA®), prior to the initial release of the first FHIR standard. Although now considered a legacy standard, it is still used by some clinical applications today.",

Additionally, the Act’s provisions against information blocking facilitate patient access to their health data, opening new opportunities for integrating patient-reported data into research.\nMandating Standardized APIs: By requiring health IT systems to adopt standardized APIs like FHIR, the act enables seamless and scalable data exchange. This support extends to a variety of research activities, from observational studies to real-time data analysis, by ensuring data is accessible in a consistent format across different health systems.\n\nHTI-1 Final Rule:\n\nDriving Data Standardization: The Health IT Interoperability (HTI-1) final rule updates health IT certification criteria, increasing the availability of core health data elements for exchange via FHIR. This ensures researchers can obtain more reliable and consistent data from certified EHR systems, enhancing the quality of data used in research. It also supports the adoption of updates to standardized API requirements.\nDecision Support Interventions and Predictive Models: HTI-1 extends clinical decision support certification criteria into the realm of artificial intelligence. The Decision Support Intervention (DSI) criteria promote transparency of the algorithms, data, and processes used in developing predictive models for DSI, ensuring that clinical decision-making tools are evidence-based and transparent.\n\nTEFCA (Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement):\n\nCreating a Standardized National Framework: TEFCA aims to establish a single, standardized framework for nationwide health data exchange, potentially providing researchers with easier access to data across various health networks. This could streamline the process of acquiring real-world health data, enhancing the ability to conduct large-scale studies and fostering collaboration across institutions.\nImproving Data Accessibility for Researchers: With TEFCA’s framework, researchers could gain access to a more extensive pool of health data, making it easier to identify patient cohorts, track outcomes, and conduct longitudinal studies.\n\n\nOpportunities for Research\n\nComprehensive Access to Real-World Data: These regulations make it possible for researchers to access more comprehensive, real-world health data, leading to a deeper understanding of patient populations and health outcomes. The 21st Century Cures Act and HTI-1 have laid a new foundation for health interoperability, with standardized core electronic health data becoming more widely available. These regulations further support transparent development of clinical decision support technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms in health applications. The act’s information blocking provisions empower patients to access their health data, potentially opening new doors for patient-facilitated research.\nFacilitating Collaboration: Standardized data formats and exchange protocols offer new opportunities for multi-site and cross-institutional research collaborations, allowing for larger sample sizes and more diverse data sets.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Gaps\n\nEnsuring Data Privacy: With increased data sharing, maintaining patient privacy and complying with regulations like HIPAA is a critical concern. Researchers must navigate the complexities of de-identifying data and ensuring secure access.\nOvercoming Technical Barriers: Aligning diverse data-sharing practices and integrating various EHR systems can be technically challenging. Researchers may also encounter varying interpretations of regulatory requirements, which can affect data exchange.",

    "text": "3 Industry Innovations and Their Impact\n\n3.1 AI and Machine Learning\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing healthcare by enabling the analysis of vast datasets to extract meaningful patterns, enhance diagnostics, and predict health outcomes. These technologies have found applications across various medical fields, including radiology, cardiology, oncology, and ophthalmology—significantly improving patient care and operational efficiency.\nFor instance, in radiology, AI algorithms assist in detecting anomalies in medical images, aiding in the early diagnosis of diseases (Hosny et al. (2018)). In oncology, ML models predict cancer progression and patient responses to treatments, facilitating personalized medicine (Shimizu and Nakayama (2020)). In cardiology, AI tools analyze electronic health records (EHRs) to predict cardiovascular events, improving preventive care strategies (Krittanawong et al. (2019)). In ophthalmology, AI systems have been developed to detect retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma from fundus photographs with high accuracy, enabling early intervention and management (Li et al. (2018)).\nThe effectiveness of AI and ML in healthcare hinges on the availability of large volumes of high-quality, standardized data. In this context, the FHIR standard emerges as a crucial enabler. AI and ML algorithms require data that is not only vast in quantity but also consistent in structure. The use of standardized data formats like FHIR ensures that data from various sources can be integrated seamlessly. This standardization is critical for training AI models effectively, as it reduces the variability and potential errors that can arise from disparate data formats.\nFHIR enables the integration of diverse data types, such as electronic health records (EHRs), imaging data, and patient-reported outcomes. By providing a common framework, FHIR facilitates interoperability between different healthcare systems and devices. This interoperability is essential for aggregating the large datasets needed for AI and ML applications.\nFurthermore, FHIR enhances data interoperability by allowing for real-time data exchange. This capability is particularly beneficial in AI-driven Clinical Decision Support (CDS), where patient data needs to be transmitted quickly and securely to trigger the AI model or provide data for inference.\n\n\n3.2 Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics\nThe rapid increase in healthcare data, including electronic health records (EHRs) and information from wearable devices, has made traditional on-premises data storage less practical. Cloud platforms offer scalable and flexible infrastructures that can handle vast amounts of data, providing healthcare organizations with the ability to store, manage, and analyze information more efficiently.\nCloud services enable the aggregation of diverse data types into a centralized repository, facilitating seamless data sharing and collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, and patients. By leveraging FHIR APIs and clinical terminologies, cloud-based solutions reduce integration challenges that stem from data from different sources and systems. This interoperability is crucial for creating comprehensive patient records and supporting coordinated care efforts across multiple providers and healthcare systems.\nCloud platforms also support advanced big data analytics by providing the computational power necessary to process large datasets. Healthcare organizations can utilize cloud-based analytics tools to perform real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning applications. For instance, analyzing population health trends or predicting patient outcomes becomes more feasible when computational resources can scale according to demand. For infrequent or variable workflows, this scalability not only enhances operational efficiency but also reduces the costs associated with maintaining extensive on-premises IT infrastructures. However, on-premises solutions may be more cost-effective for high-volume, consistent workloads in the long term.\nCloud computing promotes innovation by enabling researchers to access and analyze data on-demand from anywhere, unconstrained by local infrastructure. This facilitates streamlined collaboration as data can be securely shared and accessed globally. The adoption of standardized data formats like FHIR further enhances collaboration, helping to ensure consistency and reliability in data analysis across various research domains.\nA notable example of a cloud-based clinical data initiative is the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) (Haendel et al. (2021)). N3C is a nationwide effort that aggregates and harmonizes EHR data from numerous healthcare institutions into a centralized, secure cloud environment specifically for COVID-19 research. While not currently FHIR-based, N3C recognizes the potential of FHIR for future development, as it may offer enhanced interoperability and alignment with emerging health data standards. The N3C platform allows for advanced big data analytics, facilitating studies on disease progression, treatment efficacy, and long-term outcomes related to COVID-19, with the goal of improving patient care and public health responses to the pandemic.\n\nBenefits\nThe integration of cloud computing and big data analytics in healthcare offers numerous advantages:\n\nSupport for Large-Scale Research Studies: Cloud platforms enable the collection and analysis of extensive datasets from diverse sources. Researchers can conduct large-scale studies that were previously impractical due to data storage and processing limitations. This capability accelerates medical research and the development of new treatments and interventions.\nReal-Time Data Analysis: Cloud computing facilitates the rapid processing of incoming data, allowing healthcare providers to analyze information as it is generated. This real-time capability supports timely clinical decision-making, enhances patient monitoring, and improves the responsiveness of healthcare services.\n\n\n\nChallenges\nDespite these benefits, several challenges need to be addressed:\n\nData Security: Protecting sensitive health information in the cloud is a critical concern. Ensuring compliance with regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Health Breach Notification Rule requires robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. Any breaches can have severe legal and ethical implications, including substantial fines and damage to an organization’s reputation.\nIntegration Complexity: Migrating existing systems to cloud platforms can be complex. Compatibility issues arise, especially with legacy systems or non-standardized data formats. While adopting interoperability standards like FHIR is essential, it may require considerable effort to implement effectively across all systems involved.\nNeed for Technical Expertise: Implementing and maintaining cloud-based solutions necessitates specialized knowledge. Healthcare organizations may face challenges in recruiting or training staff with expertise in cloud technologies, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Investing in staff training or partnering with experienced vendors can help address this gap but may increase operational costs.\n\nWhen implemented effectively, and by leveraging standards like FHIR, these technologies have the potential to significantly enhance patient care, advance medical research, and improve the overall efficiency of healthcare services.",

    "section": "2 Common API requests for research",
    "text": "2 Common API requests for research\nResearchers will typically be reading data from a FHIR server rather than modifying data on the FHIR server. Requests to read data for research purposes will typically be one of the following:\n\nGetting instances of resources for a specific patient\nGetting all patients that meet a certain set of criteria\n\nExamples of API requests for these use cases are described below. For additional information on FHIR’s search capabilities, please see the Search page in the FHIR specification.\n\n2.1 Getting instances of resources for a specific patient\nThe example above (GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702) shows how to get the instance of Patient for the patient with the ID 591702.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking requests to a FHIR server\n\n\n\nBecause FHIR’s RESTful interface uses standard HTTP requests, it is possible to make GET requests by pasting a URL like https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702into your browser’s address bar (omit the GET when using your browser, as loading web pages uses GET by default).\nHowever, it may be helpful to use an API testing tool like Postman or Hoppscotch when constructing FHIR searches for testing, or viewing longer responses. Note that caution should be used when loading real patient data with FHIR via third-party tools. The FHIR search examples in this module use synthetic data so this is not a concern here.\nYou can also use Python or another scripting language to make FHIR API requests and parse the responses. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to do this with Python.\n\n\nIt is possible to get resources related to this patient as well. For example, to get all the Observation resources associated with patient 591702, make the following request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_id=591702&_revinclude=Observation:patient\nNote that rather than including the ID as part of the URL like in GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702, this request uses the _id parameter. This is necessary because we need to use the search interaction rather than the read interaction3 to retrieve multiple instances at once.\nThis request also uses the _revinclude parameter, which tells the FHIR server to follow the “reverse link” to identify instances of Observation where the reference in Observation.patient refers to one of the instances of Patient returned by the search.\nThe response to a search interaction is an instance of the Bundle resource, which contains the instances of the Patient and Observation resources returned by the server in response to the search. More information on Bundle can be found in Key FHIR Resources.\nDepending on your query, the response may be too large for the sever to easily return all at once. In this case, the server may employ paging to split up the response. If it does, the response will include an entry in the link element that indicate the URL that provides the relation=\"next\" page. To retrieve all the results, you will need to issue a GET request to the next URLs on each page of results. The last page of results will not have a next URL populated.\n\nMultiple types of resources\nThe same approach can be used to get multiple types of resources at once. The query below will include both Observation and Condition instances for the specified patient using multiple _revinclude parameters:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_id=591702&_revinclude=Observation:patient&_revinclude=Condition:patient\n\n\nGet instances of a resource without including Patient\nIf you want to get just the instances of a resource like Observation for a patient, without including the instance of Patient, the following approach can be used:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?patient=591702\nThis instructs the server to return instances of Observation where Observation.patient=591702.\n\n\n\n2.2 Getting all patients that meet specified criteria\nFHIR’s search interaction does not allow for the same degree of filtering logic as a SQL-style query in a relational database. However, it does include some ability to filter with AND/OR logic, or by other criteria. Below are a few examples of this functionality.\nTo get all the patients who have an Observation observation with a specific value of Observation.code, make the following request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_has:Observation:patient:code=http://loinc.org|718-7\nThis requests all instances of Patient that are associated with an instance of Observation via Observation.patient, and have Observation.code=http://loinc.org|718-7 via reverse chaining. (718-7 is the LOINC for “Hemoglobin [Mass/volume] in Blood”.)\nIf you want the instances of Observation along with Patient, you can use this request instead:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?code=http://loinc.org|718-7&_include=Observation:patient\nThe _include parameter tells the server to return instances of Observation where code=http://loinc.org|718-7, and then to follow the reference in Observation.patient and include the referenced instances as well.\nIt is possible to perform more complex selection and filtering operations via the FHIR search API. For example, to get the subset of these observations with hemoglobin values &gt; 20, make this request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?code=http://loinc.org|718-7&_has:Observation&value-quantity=gt20\nThe parameter value-quantity=gt20 tells the server to take the subset of the selected Observation instances with Observation.valueQuantity greater than (gt) 20. Care should be used when analyzing the response to ensure Observation.valueQuantity.units is consistent.\nA number of other logic and filtering capabilities are described in detail on in a section on the Search page in the FHIR specification.",

    "text": "1 CDMs and FHIR\nCDMs and FHIR are both important parts of the health research data ecosystem, but differ in key ways:\n\nPurpose and scope\n\nCDMs: Provide a consistent structure for storing and querying health data to faciliate research.\nFHIR: Enable interoperability between health IT systems (which can included research-related systems).\n\n\n\nStructure\n\nCDMs: Typically, CDMs consist of a standardized set of relational database tables, with columns for each data element. CDMs also typically define standardized terminology for representing concepts.\nFHIR: FHIR defines resources for each type of data, which can be extended to add additional data elements as needed for a given use case. Resources have a nested structure (like a multi-level outline) rather than a tabular structure (like a spreadsheet). The base FHIR specification does have strict terminology constraints, though these can be added for a specific use case in an Implementation Guide.\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nCDMs: Typically implemented as a database within a research data warehouse. When CDMs are used as part of a research data network, additional mechanisms may be implemented for sharing data across the network (Weeks and Pardee, n.d.).\nFHIR: Typically implemented as an API within a health IT system like an EHR, though research-specific databases may also implement FHIR (e.g., Kids First).\n\nBecause of these differences, FHIR does not obviate existing CDMs and health data networks. However, FHIR can be used in conjunction with CDMs. For example:\n\nPopulating a CDM: FHIR can be used as part of the process for populating a CDM. Typically, data are extracted from EHRs and other clinical or billing systems, transformed into the CDM’s format, and then loaded into the CDM database. (Note that this type of process is generally referred to as ETL for Extract, Transform, Load.) FHIR can be used as the input into an ETL process, which may allow for ETL logic that is more portable across institutions and EHR installations.\nMapping between CDMs: The Common Data Models Harmonization IG uses FHIR to map and translate between PCORNet, i2b2, OMOP, and Sentinel (all described below).\nPortable phenotypes: FHIR and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) were used by Brandt et al. (2022) to create phenotypes for cohort definitions. These were translated to run against the OMOP CDM. Theoretically, institutions that do not have OMOP research databases could use FHIR and CQL directly to identify cases and non-cases.",

    "text": "2 Notable CDMs\nIf you are not familiar with CMS, below are some notable CDMs used in the US:\n\nOMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)\nSentinel\nPCORnet (Patient-Centered Outcomes Researcher Network)\ni2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside)\n\n\n2.1 OMOP\nOMOP was originally created in 2007 by the FDA and other partners to study the effects of medical products.(Weeks and Pardee, n.d.) It is now managed by the OHDSI (Observational Health Data Science and Informatics).\nOMOP is an:\n\nopen community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data and to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence.\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nOMOP uses OHDSI standardized vocabularies. The OHDSI standardized vocabularies establish a single standard concept for each clinical entity. When data is converted into OMOP, the source concept is mapped to the corresponding standard concept. This allows researchers to interpret and use clinical entities from different organizations.(OHDSI, n.d.)\n\n\n2.2 Sentinel\nSentinel is a CDM designed to monitor whether FDA-regulated medical products cause unexpected adverse reactions.\nAlthough FDA-regulated products undergo clinical testing before approval, the testing may miss adverse reactions. This is because the test population may not fully represnt the population that uses the product. To detect and assess adverse events after approval, the FDA created Sentinel in 2007. See here for more information about the Sentinel data network.\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 PCORnet\nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed PCORnet to make clinical research more streamlined, representative, and efficient. PCORnet data is largely drawn from EHRs, as well as some patient-reported and payor data. The PCORnet includes data from 66 million patients that researchers can use for observational studies. PCORnet launched in 2014 (Fleurence et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 i2b2\nDeveloped in 2004 by Partners HealthCare and Harvard Medical School, i2b2 is an open-source research data application framework that “provides clinical and translational investigators with the tools necessary to integrate medical record and clinical research in the genomics age.” (n.d.)\ni2b2 is structured differently from the other CDMs discussed here: rather than having separate data tables for each type of data (e.g., procedures and diagnoses are stored in different database tables, each with a different set of columns), i2b2 uses the same set of tables for all data types. i2b2 refers to this as the “star schema” (see diagram below). i2b2 describes this as follows:\n\nInstead of separate tables for diagnoses, medications, and other data types, all patient observations are stored in a single “fact” table. A separate ontology describes the different codes that are placed in this fact table. As a result, institutions can use their own local codes, without having to map to common code sets. Furthermore, institutions can easily add new types of data to i2b2 and tranSMART just by extending the ontology. No changes to the database or software are needed. This enables software developers to build query, analysis, and visualization tools that are generalizable to different types of data and future-proof since the i2b2 CDM can remain stable over time.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the i2b2 “star schema”, from .",

This means that conforming FHIR servers should provide the data elements if they are available.\nAre there any required data elements that are problematic from a research perspective? (E.g., requiring a patient’s name for research on deidentified data.)\n\nAre there terminology bindings, and are they sufficiently strong to ensure consistent output?\n\nNote that unless a terminology binding is set at the “required” level, FHIR servers may still return concepts that are not in the bound ValueSet.\nThis is especially relevant for using FHIR across different systems or institutions, which may use different terminology. It may be necessary to map to a single set of concepts, either as part of the FHIR implementation or during data analysis.\n\nIs the IG implemented on the relevant FHIR servers you wish to get data from?

All work groups are open to participation by anyone with an interest in their content.\n\nHL7 Work Groups consist of subject matter experts and other stakeholders. Each Work Group has a mailing list that may be joined to communicate with the Work Group, including asking for time on an upcoming conference call. Work Groups also post conference call agendas on their Confluence sites (see the Work Group directory for Confluence links).\nEach Work Group lists their associated projects. Work Groups typically meet on a weekly basis for a conference call. There is a core leadership team for each Work Group that facilitates meetings. Attendees vary depending on agenda content.\nWork Groups also meet in-person or hybrid at HL7 Working Group Meetings, which are held three times per year.\n\nGetting started with Work Groups\nThe fastest way to get started in a Work Group is to join its conference call and ask to introduce yourself.\nAlternatively (or additionally), join the Work Group’s mailing list and reach out to the group’s leadership to introduce yourself. You may also use the mailing list to request future agenda items.\n\n\nTips for attending Work Group meetings:\n\nAsk to be on the agenda ahead of the meeting to get specific questions addressed.\nBe prepared to discuss your agenda item(s). Agendas are available ahead of the meeting on the Work Group’s Confluence page.\nShare your expertise. To ensure that new projects and specifications may be used by the community, Work Groups require input from a variety of stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Zulip (chat.fhir.org)\nZulip (chat.fhir.org) is an asynchronous communication platform like Slack or Teams messaging. Anyone may join. The platform is a valuable resource for asking questions and connecting with others with similar projects or objectives.\nZulip has “streams” (like “channels” on Slack) for general topics like Implementation Guide development and Terminology, as well as domain-specific topics like Cancer Interoperability. Users post comments or questions inside a stream, and others respond. You may find applicable streams by searching for a topic or browsing through the stream list.\n\nGetting started with Zulip\nBefore using Zulip, review HL7’s community expectations.\nIf you have a question and don’t know which stream to post it in, the #implementers stream is a good place to start.\nOther useful streams to subscribe to include:\n\n#Announcements: posts with new streams, releases of new versions of specifications, and ballot updates\n#implementers: discussion about implementing FHIR resources\n#analytics on FHIR: useful for those using FHIR interfaces and APIs for data analytics\n#social: general discussion about the FHIR community with the occasional fun update from a community member\n\n\n\n\n2.3 HL7 FHIR Connectathons\nHL7 FHIR Connectathons are events that connect contributors and community members to test FHIR technology. HL7 describes a Connectathon as:\n\n…an event that is centered on developing the HL7 FHIR Specification including resources, profiles and implementation guides. The purpose of a Connectathon is to prove that the specification is complete and facilitate FHIR implementation guide maturity.\n\nThree Connectathons are held each year, either as in-person events or as virtual meetings. Anyone may attend as a participant or submit a proposal to be a Track Lead. Connectathon Track Leads share their specification or resource for implementers to test and offer feedback. A complete list of the Tracks is posted before the Connectathon. You may also view offerings from previous Connectathons.\n\nGetting started\nFind information about upcoming Connectathons on HL7’s Connectathon events page or the Connectathon Confluence page.\nThe Connectathon FAQs provide information on requirements to participate.\nFirst time attendees must watch the FHIR Training for Beginners Newcomer Orientation.\nEach Connectathon hosts a virtual Participant Information Session several weeks before the event. The Participant Information Session includes information about which Tracks are available, how to connect with Track Leads, and how to prepare your sandbox environment for testing. For an example of what to expect, a recording of the January 2023 Connectathon Participant Information Session is available, as well as the check lists for attendees and Track Leads.\n\n\n\n2.4 FHIR Accelerators\nIn addition to developing the FHIR standard, HL7 has a FHIR Accelerator program to “assist communities and collaborative groups across the global health care spectrum in the creation and adoption of high quality FHIR Implementation Guides or other standard artifacts to move toward the realization of global health data interoperability.”\nFHIR Accelerators drive adoption of FHIR for specific use cases, including:\n\nCodeX: Standardizing cancer data\nDa Vinci: Establishing a process for addressing value-based care delivery\nGravity: Standardizing social determinants of health\nHelios: Obtaining data for public health via FHIR\nVulcan: Obtaining data for research via FHIR\n\nResearchers may be especially interested in Vulcan. This presentation from FHIR DevDays 2022 provides an overview of Vulcan’s current activity (PDF slides):\n\nMore information on the FHIR to OMOP project that is part of Vulcan can be found here.",

Confluence is a Wikipedia-like documentation website for HL7. Many of the links throughout this module go to HL7 Confluence pages. The site is useful for finding:\n\nHL7 projects in development\nSchedules and information for HL7 Work Groups\nProcesses and documentation for HL7 and FHIR infrastructure\n\nThe Confluence site also includes tips on getting involved and implementer support.\n\n\n3.2 HL7 Jira\nProject work and specification development primarily occurs in HL7 Jira. The site is an issue-tracking resource used for managing comments and suggestions on HL7 specifications and terminologies. This includes the core FHIR specification and FHIR IGs developed with HL7 Work Group oversight.\n\n\n3.3 FHIR Community Forum\nWhile the FHIR Community Forum is no longer active as a discussion platform, the posts have been archived for historical reference. You will find posts to previous questions like:\n\n\nHow do I do [x]? where [x] is any kind of use of FHIR at all\nHas anyone solved [my problem] with the specification? (Or is anyone interested in this?)\nWhy does FHIR work like it does?\nWhat does everyone think about [making some change to the FHIR specification]?\n\n\nThe FHIR Community Forum is no longer used or monitored. All discussion has transitioned to Zulip (chat.fhir.org).\n\n\n3.4 StackOverflow on FHIR\nStackOverflow is a third-party forum for asking and answering technical questions. HL7 FHIR is one of the topics discussed on StackOverflow, in addition to many other technologies unrelated to health. Use the hl7-fhir tag for developer and programming questions about reference FHIR implementations.",

    "section": "4 Navigating the HL7 standards development process",
    "text": "4 Navigating the HL7 standards development process\nThe standards development process requires walking a fine line between adoptability and thoroughness. HL7 describes the balance of the standards process:\n\nSpend too little time and energy and the standard is unlikely to be fit for purpose or see much adoption. Take too long or require too much investment and the community will move on before the specification is declared “fit for use”.\n\n\n4.1 HL7 balloting in the standards development process\nHL7 balloting is defined as:\n\n…the formal process that HL7 uses to get feedback and comments on specifications prior to publication. Rules governing balloting are defined in both HL7’s Governance and Operations Manual and in the HL7 Essential Requirements. These, in turn, are governed by the expectations of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) which accredits HL7 as a standards development organization and enforces rules around the openness and fairness of approval processes. The objective of balloting is to actively seek feedback on a proposed standard and to ensure that the community that will be governed by that standard is in agreement with the expectations set by the standard.\n\n\n\n4.2 HL7 ballot process and levels\nFor a project that wants to pursue the HL7 balloting process, the first step is to create an HL7 Project Proposal. Project Proposals are reviewed by HL7 co-chairs and approved by a sponsoring Work Group that fits with the content or subject matter for the proposal. After the Project Proposal is approved by the sponsoring Work Group, a Project Scope Statement, which includes more detailed information about the proposed project, must be submitted and reviewed.\nThe next step in the balloting process is to begin IG development. There are four levels of ballots:\n\nFor Comment: opportunity for developers to solicit feedback early in the development process\nInformative: used to vet content that is non-binding, like recommendations and guidance for implementers\nStandard for Trial Use (STU): for vetting content that will be binding on implementers. IGs in this ballot period are ready to be used but have not been widely implemented.\nNormative: this stage is the final ballot level and once the requirements are meant, IGs at this level are authoritative. A high level of consensus is required to meet the normative status since any changes are binding.\n\nDuring a ballot, a specification is “frozen” for a specified period of time to give balloters time to submit comments to raise issues or propose changes. Balloters may cast votes to publish the specification. The sponsoring Work Group will review the comments to resolve issues raised during a ballot.\nThe significance of the balloting process and ballot levels for researchers is discussed more in balloting implications for researchers.\n\n\n4.3 HL7 ballot examples\nBalloting is managed through two tools:\n\nHL7 Ballot Desktop: manages ballot announcements and captures the formal record of ballot submissions.\nJira Ballot Process: manages comments and records the votes of balloters.\n\nTwo research related IGs undergoing the HL7 balloting process are the following:\n\nThe Longitudinal Maternal & Infant Health information for Research IG supports maternal health researchers by defining a standard for aggregating and analyzing clinical information for birthing people and their infants. Researchers with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), co-authored the specification.\nThe Single Institutional Review Board (sIRB) IG aims to facilitate multi-site research by combining individual IRB requirements into a single application process, lowering administrative burdens and expediting the research process.\n\n\n\n4.4 Pros of balloting through HL7\nThere are several benefits of balloting an IG through HL7, including visibility, implementation, and reusability:\n\nVisibility: developing projects are socialized early and often throughout the balloting process, so many stakeholders within the HL7 community are aware of them\nImplementation: greater visibility prevents standards from being developed in isolation. Successful implementation is more likely since there are many opportunities for the potential future implementers to offer input throughout the balloting process\nReusability: the combination of visibility and successful implementation supports reusability of the profiles within an IG, which is beneficial for the standards development process. Reusing existing IG content is conducive to interoperability.\n\n\n\n4.5 Cons of balloting through HL7\nBalloting through HL7 is not necessarily a requirement though and some use cases may find the significant time and effort required to complete the process too cumbersome. Reaching the Standards for Trial Use (STU) phase, where an IG can officially be trialed in a pilot-like environment, can take 1-2 years and then an additional 3 years before reaching the normative stage, where a standard is widely accepted and implemented. HL7 has some guidance on publishing IGs outside of HL7\nTwo IGs that were not balloted through HL7:\n\nThe NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort (NCPI) FHIR Implementation Guide (NCPI FHIR IG) is a relatively newer IG that is still under development. The IG aims to support data and knowledge-sharing among researchers by using FHIR as a standard, common model for representing data.\nThe OHSU Hypertension Implementation Guide is a patient-facing support tool for hypertension management. Funded by AHRQ, the IG uses CDS Hooks to support the clinical decision support logic.\n\n\n\n4.6 Balloting implications for researchers\nThere are implications and considerations for researchers that may want to use an existing specification that is moving through the balloting process or ballot their own specification.\n\nConsider the ballot level. Specifications that are earlier in the balloting stages are more likely to change as they mature. It would be riskier to base a research project on the assumption that the IG will remain as it’s written.\n\nIs community consensus important? If garnering a strong community and consensus among the group is important to the success of a research effort, then balloting would likely help. Generally, adoption and implementation are more likely for IG’s that go through the balloting process. Particularly if industry support is desired, balloting is a great way to socialize an idea and unite interested stakeholders.\n\n\n\n4.7 More information on balloting\nThe balloting process can be daunting and confusing after the first introduction. The following steps may help to clarify the process:\n\nJoin a Work Group meeting.\nJoin the chat.fhir.org workspace, and particularly the #Ballot-QA stream to read previous questions and answers or ask new questions.\nConnect with others in the HL7 community that have worked on balloted specifications, either through chat.fhir.org or through the Confluence work space. The community is vast and friendly; asking someone for advice may save you from sifting through Confluence to find the answer.",

    "text": "1 The structure of FHIR\nThe FHIR specification groups data elements into “resources,” like Patient for representing demographics and administrative information about an individual, and Observation for representing measurements and assertions about a patient or other subject.\nFHIR implementers can constrain what information gets included in a FHIR resource or use FHIR extensions to add information to a resource. They can also specify which FHIR resources should be used together for their use case. They share these constraints, extensions, and combinations with others through an Implementation Guide (IG).\nBelow is a screenshot of the Patient resource from the FHIR specification (R5 version):\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\nAll FHIR resources have a Resource Content table.1 The table shows the hierarchy of elements in the FHIR resource. Elements might be one level deep (like Patient.birthDate) or nested (like Patient.contact.name).\nEach element has properties that appear in the Flag, Card. (short for “Cardinality”), and Type columns. The details of these properties are beyond the scope of this module; see Key FHIR Resources for more information.\nElements also have short descriptions (Description & Constraints) as well as longer descriptions. To see the longer description, click on the element’s name (e.g., see the details of Patient.gender).\nWhen a FHIR resource is created and populated with data, we call this an instance of the FHIR resource. An instance of the Patient resource would assign Patient.name to a value like Andy Smith. Instances are formatted in JSON or XML. To see an example of a patient instance formatted as JSON, expand the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON format FHIR Patient instance example\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of a what a FHIR resource instance looks like in JSON format.\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"f001\",\n  \"text\": {\n    \"status\": \"generated\",\n    \"div\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"identifier\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\",\n      \"value\": \"738472983\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"gender\": \"male\",\n  \"birthDate\": \"1944-11-17\",\n  \"deceasedBoolean\": false,\n  \"managingOrganization\": {\n    \"reference\": \"Organization/f001\",\n    \"display\": \"Burgers University Medical Centre\"\n  }\n}",

    "section": "2 Customizing FHIR",
    "text": "2 Customizing FHIR\nThe FHIR specification follows the 80/20 rule to determine which data elements are included in a resource: data elements are typically included only if 80% of relevant systems will use them. Less common data needs are handled through FHIR extensions (discussed below). This means that FHIR-enabled systems will implement most common data elements consistently.\nTo maximize usability, data elements contained in FHIR resources have minimal constraints. Constraints restrict how a data element can be populated. For example, a constraint on Patient resource might require that Patient.birthDate be populated. However, some systems record a patient’s age in years rather than date of birth for privacy reasons. If the constraint on Patient.birthDate existed, those system would not be able to use the Patient resource.\nHowever, some use cases may require Patient.birthDate be populated. To achieve this, implementers can define use case-specific constraints on top of the base FHIR specification through profiling. The output of profiling is an Implementation Guide (IG), which is a collection of profiles that build on top of the FHIR specification (or other IGs).\n\n2.1 Example: customizing Patient in US Core\nThe US Core FHIR IG (referred to as “US Core” below) defines a FHIR implementation for USCDI, and is widely used in the US as the basis for FHIR implementations. In other words, EHRs in the US that support FHIR are likely also conformant with US Core.\nUS Core defines a profile of Patient, which does two things:\n\nAdds constraints: For example, the Patient resource in base FHIR does not require that the name element is populated. US Core’s profile of Patient adds a constraint to make name required.2\nAdds extensions: The base Patient resource in FHIR does not provide a way to capture patient race and ethnicity, which are common data elements in US health data. US Core adds Patient.us-core-race and Patient.us-core-ethnicity extensions to provide a consistent, interoperable way to store these data.\n\nMany other FHIR IGs include profiles that are based on US Core rather than directly on FHIR resources. For example, the mCODE IG, which defines a core set of data elements for oncology EHR data, includes a CancerPatient profile that is based on US Core’s Patient profile. Because US Core is widely implemented in US-based EHRs, it is helpful to base US-centric IGs off of US Core.\n\n\n2.2 Example: post-acute care data\nThe PACIO Project is a post-acute care interoperability project that publishes a FHIR IG to support exchange of relevant data.3\nThe following table shows how PACIO represents a narrative history of a patient’s functional status4 in their IG:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFHIR term\nPACIO’s approach using FHIR\nCommentary\n\n\n\n\nResource\nFunctional status data are represented with the Observation FHIR resource.\n“Observations are a central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns…”5\n\n\nProfile\nPACIO provides a Narrative History of Functional Status profile of the Observation resource.\nAdds constraints like:\n\nRequire performer element to indicate who performed the assessment\nIdentifying functional status narrative records with LOINC concept 10158-4 (History of Functional status Narrative).\n\n\n\nExtension\nTwo extensions are defined by this profile:\n\nevent-location indicates where the observed event occurred.\nassistance-required indicates the level of assistance needed by the patient during assessment.\n\nThe base Observation resource does not have a mechanism for capturing these types of data.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, a concept like “narrative history of a patient’s functional status” will be represented by one or more profiles of FHIR resources in a FHRI IG, each with a set of relevant constraints and (if necessary) extensions.\nNote that extensions can make interoperability more difficult compared to using data elements in the base FHIR resources, so they should be used only when needed.\n\n\n2.3 Customizing FHIR and research\nThere are two research considerations for customizing FHIR:\n\nAre there existing FHIR Implementation Guides that are relevant? For example, oncology clinical trials might be able to take advantage of the mCODE IG. Find other potentially relevant IGs here.\nWould creating a FHIR Implementation Guide provide value? For research that uses FHIR-formatted data, creating a study-specific IG provides a way to easily define element definitions and required data elements. More information on writing IGs is here.",

As mentioned in Part 1, FHIR’s API uses a RESTful approach, which is a widely used throughout the technology industry. Find more specifics on FHIR’s API in the Accessing FHIR Data module.\nThe diagram below shows how FHIR’s API connects systems to each other:\n\nFor example, a FHIR Client (like the Apple Health app on an iPhone) can request data from a FHIR server using the “RESTful API over HTTP.” FHIR standardizes the request so the Apple Health app can use the same request regardless of which FHIR server they contact.\nLike with FHIR resources, the standard FHIR API doesn’t define all necessary operations for every use case. FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) can also define additional API capabilities for a specific use case.",

    "text": "3 FHIR\nHL7 developed FHIR in the early 2010s to provide a more interoperable alternative to V2 and a simpler alternative to V3.1 Like V3, FHIR uses common data formats (like JSON and XML). It also uses a common architecture (REST) for communication between systems. These design decisions make FHIR-enabled systems easier to integrate with mobile and cloud-based health applications compared to V2.\nRecall from FHIR from 1,000 Feet that:\n\nThe FHIR specification follows the 80/20 rule to determine which data elements are included in a resource: data elements are typically included only if 80% of relevant systems will use them. Less common data needs are handled through FHIR extensions. This means that FHIR-enabled systems will implement most common data elements consistently.\n\nIn late 2014, HL7 released the first official version of FHIR. In 2015, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) issued the 2015 Edition Cures Act certification criteria, which included an API criteria. While the API criteria did not target a specific standard, many adopted FHIR for the criteria. ONC continued to refine the certification’s criteria through revisions of the 2015 Edition Cures Act, and by 2019, 87% of hospitals in the US were using ONC certified EHRs with FHIR APIs as seen below. (Posnack and Barker 2018)\n\n\n\n87% of hospitals in the US were using ONC certified EHRs with FHIR APIs by 2019.\n\n\nThe late 2010s saw adoption outside of EHRs. For example, Apple uses FHIR in HealthKit for accessing patient health data directly from EHRs. Moreover, three major public cloud vendors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) provide FHIR-enabled services as well.\n\n3.1 FHIR releases\nAs of April 2023, the most recent version of the FHIR specification is Release 5 (often referred to as “FHIR R5”). ONC provides a summary of FHIR releases since the first release in 2012:\n\nHL7® FHIR® has evolved through four releases since its initial presentation in May 2012. It has grown from a true draft standard with 49 Resources to its current 145 and continues to expand. In that time the standard has improved and changed to meet the needs of the health information technology community.\nDraft standard for trial use 1 (DSTU1)\nFHIR’s first publication in September 2013 showed a new way forward for health care data exchange. Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 had 49 resources and focused on two use cases, creating a Personal Health Record on a mobile device and the retrieval of documents, such as encounter or discharge notes, to a mobile device. This initial release sparked the community’s interest in expanding FHIR to cover a wider variety of health care and health IT needs.\nDraft standard for trial use 2 (DSTU2)\nFHIR grew in market acceptance with the publication of the Draft Standard for Trial Use 2 in 2015. Efforts including the Argonaut Project developed Implementation Guides (IGs) and other technologies to support FHIR adoption by EHR developers and other health IT entities. The structure of Resources was adjusted to make creating extensions easier, allowing for more use cases to be covered without changes to the core standard. New Resources were also added to support non-clinical data, including claims and benefits processing.\nThe publication of FHIR DSTU2 included the creation of the FHIR Maturity Model (FMM). When new Resources are created, they are not immediately ready for use in live settings; they must be refined and tested for a variety of uses and settings. The FHIR Maturity Model established a set of levels that progressively measure technical advancement, known as maturity. Resource maturity as defined by the FMM begins with an initial draft and achieves final status with implementation in multiple settings. Since the maturity of the FHIR standard overall is not tied to the maturity of Resources, Resources can move up the maturity ladder between FHIR releases. The FMM, which is also applied to other components of the FHIR standard, defines Resource stability with six levels:\n\nFMM0 (Draft) - The resource is still in early development but has been accepted into the FHIR standard.\nFMM1 - The Resource has no current technical errors and is believed to address all design goals.\nFMM2 - The Resource has been tested and approved at a FHIR Connectathon with multiple FHIR-enabled computer systems tested.\nFMM3 - The Resource passed all quality checks and an HL7 community ballot that determines if it is ready for trial use.\nFMM4 - The Resource has been tested for functionality for all intended purposes, has been published in a formal HL7 publication, and is operating in at least one prototype system.\nFMM5 - The Resource is in use in at least five distinct production systems operating in at least two countries.\n\nSubstantive changes at the FMM4 or FMM5 levels that would change usage from those already established or would break compatibility with existing implementations would require significant justification to be accepted and to move forward. After FMM5, a Resource reaches “normative”1 level; at this level, future changes must be backwards compatible so that applications that implement those Resources aren’t at risk of being broken as the FHIR standard changes.\nStandard for trial use 3 (STU 3)\nFHIR Standard for Trial Use 3 was released in 2017 with improvements to the core Clinical, Administrative, and Financial Resources, improvements to the Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Measure Resources and a new framework for workflow and task management. Additionally, tools were introduced that made FHIR IG creation and publication to the web easier, faster, and more unified.\nRelease 4 (R4)\nAs the first release with normative content, the 2019 release of FHIR Release 4 left behind the Trial Use name. Two key clinical Resources, Patient and Observation, were released as normative, along with the RESTful API, the XML and JSON formats, and nine additional Resources.\nIn 2020, ONC published the Final Rule for the 21st Century Cures Act, establishing FHIR R4 as the standard required for Health IT Certification.\nLooking ahead to Release 5 (R5)\nFHIR Release 5 will see increased normative content, with over 30 Resources having been nominated by their HL7 Workgroups to be matured to that status. In addition, the community will continue to develop the supportive specifications to FHIR, such as the authorization framework SMART, Clinical Decision Support Hooks (CDS Hooks), and the Bulk Data Transfer specification, which will help implementers create a complete FHIR-based exchange of health care data.\nWith the maturing of the FHIR IG tools and templates, better integration with public health, imaging, financial management, genomics and other fields will keep FHIR at the forefront of health IT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: FHIR R5 was officially released in March 2023.",

    "text": "4 The Patient resource\nHere is a FHIR structure table for the Patient resource:\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\nAll FHIR resources have a similar table representing their contents. These tables have the following columns:\n\nName: The element name.\nFlags: Special markers that carry information required for implementers. The flags N, ?!, and Σ represent normative, is-modifier, and in-summary respectively. We will not cover FHIR attribute flags in detail here, but HL7 documents them.\nCard.: The cardinality of the attribute in format {minimum}..{maximum}. Cardinality refers to the number of data points an element can hold. The most intuitive cardinality values are 1..1 which means “one value required” and 0..1, which means “one value is optional. However, other options are possible, like 0..*, which means”any number of values.”3\nType: The primitive or complex data type. A primitive data type is a base data type, like date or integer. A complex data type is constructed from other data types, like Address.\nDescription & Constraints: A human-targeted explanation of the element that may contain constraints that implementers must enforce. Constraints (like “element X must be populated if element Y is missing”) may be formally defined through a language called FHIRPath.\n\nDefining a FHIR resource automatically generates a structure table, so structure tables are available for any resource.\n\n4.1 Basic types example: Patient.active\nUnder “Patient” there is an element active which is referred to as Patient.active. From the table we know that Patient.active is a boolean (i.e., “true” or “false”) and can either be omitted or have one value (cardinality 0..1).\nAn example of the Patient.active element in JSON format would look like:\n{\n  ...\n  \"active\": \"true\",\n  ...\n}\nAnd in XML:\n...\n&lt;active value=\"true\"/&gt;\n...\n\n\n4.2 Complex types example: Patient.name\nPatient.name is of complex type HumanName. Complex types are FHIR resources and have their own structure table. Here’s the one for HumanName:\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\nHumanName’s elements all have primitive types, such as HumanName.given, an array of zero or more strings, and HumanName.use, a code-string that must be one of the provided values. As an example, the name Pieter van de Heuvel would be represented in JSON as:\n{\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flexibility of FHIR’s data modeling approach\n\n\n\nThe structure of HumanName highlights the flexibility of FHIR’s approach to modeling data. HumanName allocates seven separate elements to represent a person’s name. Compare this with a standard approach in a relational database, which would typically allocate only a few fields.\nIn FHIR, all of these elements are, allowing for flexibility in how implementers represent names. For example, some implementers might store names as a single string (e.g., Pieter van de Heuvel, MSc), while others might split up the name parts into separate elements (like the JSON above).\nMaking elements optional balances flexibility with interoperability: this approach provides a standard location and encoding for the data element in question, without requiring all systems to populate it. This approach is used throughout the core FHIR resource definitions.\nThis degree of flexibility is not helpful in all use cases. FHIR addresses this through resource Profiles, which provide a way to computably describe use case-specific constraints (e.g., “all names must include a family element”). Profiles are collected in Implementation Guides (IGs) to provide a complete specification based on FHIR for a given use case.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Choice elements example: Patient.deceased[x]\nElements that can have more than one data type are called choice elements. The Patient.deceased[x] attribute demonstrates some characteristics of a choice element.\n\nThe term Patient.deceased[x], with [x] in the name, appears in documentation only–never in an instance of Patient that’s been populated with data.\nInstead, one and only one of the following may appear in an instance of Patient: Patient.deceasedBoolean or Patient.deceasedDateTime. The documentation shows that these are the two valid types for Patient.deceased[x].\nAll choice elements must have a maximum cardinality of 1 per the FHIR specification.\nPatient.deceased[x] happens to have a minimum cardinality of 0, so an instance of Patient may also omit both Patient.deceasedBoolean and Patient.deceasedDateTime. Other choice elements may have a minimum cardinality of 1 and require one of the indicated datatypes.\n\nThis flexibility allows the status of non-deceased patients to be represented by Patient.deceasedBoolean = false or an absent value, while deceased patients can be represented by Patient.deceasedBoolean = true or Patient.deceasedDateTime = \"2023-01-01T01:01:01\".\nChoice elements are always denoted by a [x] suffix in documentation. The [x] is replaced with the name of the datatype in CamelCase: deceased[x] becomes deceasedDateTime for the dateTime type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing choice elements\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile choice elements provide flexibility, they add complexity for implementers, including researchers. When working with choice elements, consider the following:\n\nAssume that any of a choice element’s possible types may be present. For example, a tabular representation of Patient instances would include two columns related to “deceased”: deceased_boolean and deceased_datetime. An analyst could add logic to collapse this down to a single column for a given analysis (e.g., logic like, “if deceased_datetime is not empty and deceased_boolean is missing, then set deceased_boolean to true”).\nWhen possible, use existing software libraries to do the FHIR-to-tabular conversion, such as R’s fhircrackr, which may simplify handling choice elements.\nWhen developing custom software, use FHIR’s official list of choice elements to systematically handle them rather than hard-coding special cases for each resource.\nIf possible, use FHIR profiles to add constraints to disallow undesirable datatypes for choice elements. For example, if Patient.deceasedDateTime is never useful for a given use case, a profile of Patient could disallow Patient.deceasedDateTime and require Patient.deceasedBoolean. This is like defining a data dictionary ahead of data collection and can drastically simplify analysis as long as the data sources also implement the custom profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 CodeableConcepts example: Patient.maritalStatus\nPatient.maritalStatus is a CodeableConcept, which is a commonly used complex type in FHIR. CodeableConcepts bind an attribute to a specific set of terminology concepts. Patient.maritalStatus is bound to the Marital Status Codes Value Set. For more on FHIR’s terminology resources, see the terminology module.\nIn addition to identifying a value set for the binding, a CodeableConcept also identifies the strength of the binding:\n\nrequired binding: The value of the element must be from the specified value set.\nextensible binding: If a code in the specified value set represents the concept, then that code must be used. Otherwise, a different code can be used.\npreferred binding: The use of codes from the specified value set is encouraged but not required.\nexample binding: The specified value set is an example, and codes outside the specified value set can be used freely.\n\nThe base FHIR specification generally does not have required bindings as these restrict the flexibility of resources. Instead, required bindings are added for specific use cases via FHIR profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing CodeableConcepts\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementers and researchers should consider the following when implementing CodeableConcepts:\n\nUsing a FHIR profile to require specific value sets simplifies analysis.\nUnless an element has a required binding, do not assume that FHIR data will only include codes from the specified value set. Make sure you perform an exploratory data analysis for any CodeableConcept binding strength other than required.\nFor example, the Patient.maritalStatus binding is extensible: while you may see values from the bound value set (like M for married), you may also see values from other value sets (like the SNOMED CT concept 54986009 “Engaged to be married (finding)” ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Inheritance in FHIR\nIn software engineering, inheritance is a common pattern for sharing attributes across similar classes (e.g., a parent class called “pet” might have two child classes called “dog” and “cat”. “Dog” and “cat” inherit properties from the “pet” parent class, like “name,” “weight,” and “cuteness.”).\nFHIR has a similar pattern, where resources like Patient inherit from a parent type called DomainResource. You can see this in the first row of the structure table for Patient:\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\n\nSimilarly, DomainResource is a child of Resource, which is the base of almost all FHIR resources. Because FHIR resources are children of DomainResource, they have the same set of core elements in their computable representation. This is useful if you are writing software that needs to process resource definitions from the FHIR specification.\nFHIR profiles also exhibit inheritance, where a profile inherits the constraints from another profile or from a base FHIR resource.\n\n\n4.6 A Patient Example\nTo summarize the Patient resource, here is an anonymized example from the real world:\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"f001\",\n  \"text\": {\n    \"status\": \"generated\",\n    \"div\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"identifier\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\",\n      \"value\": \"738472983\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"telecom\": [\n    {\n      \"system\": \"phone\",\n      \"value\": \"0648352638\",\n      \"use\": \"mobile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"system\": \"email\",\n      \"value\": \"p.heuvel@gmail.com\",\n      \"use\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"gender\": \"male\",\n  \"birthDate\": \"1944-11-17\",\n  \"deceasedBoolean\": false,\n  \"address\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"home\",\n      \"line\": [\n        \"Van Egmondkade 23\"\n      ],\n      \"city\": \"Amsterdam\",\n      \"postalCode\": \"1024 RJ\",\n      \"country\": \"NLD\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"maritalStatus\": {\n    \"coding\": [\n      {\n        \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-MaritalStatus\",\n        \"code\": \"M\",\n        \"display\": \"Married\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"text\": \"Getrouwd\"\n  },\n  \"multipleBirthBoolean\": true,\n  \"contact\": [\n    {\n      \"relationship\": [\n        {\n          \"coding\": [\n            {\n              \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0131\",\n              \"code\": \"C\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"name\": {\n        \"use\": \"usual\",\n        \"family\": \"Abels\",\n        \"given\": [\n          \"Sarah\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"telecom\": [\n        {\n          \"system\": \"phone\",\n          \"value\": \"0690383372\",\n          \"use\": \"mobile\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"communication\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": {\n        \"coding\": [\n          {\n            \"system\": \"urn:ietf:bcp:47\",\n            \"code\": \"nl\",\n            \"display\": \"Dutch\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"text\": \"Nederlands\"\n      },\n      \"preferred\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"managingOrganization\": {\n    \"reference\": \"Organization/f001\",\n    \"display\": \"Burgers University Medical Centre\"\n  }\n}\nNote that JSON representations of resources begin with resourceType: \"&lt;resource&gt;\" to indicate the base FHIR resource type.\nIn XML representations of resources, the tag enclosing the data identifies the resource type (in this case, &lt;Patient ...&gt; ... &lt;/Patient&gt;).\nTypically, JSON is easier to read (both for humans and computers) than XML, so JSON is used primarily in FHIR for Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing FHIR in JSON and XML\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the JSON and XML representations of FHIR, implementers and researchers should be aware of the following:\n\nIn either JSON or XML, the underlying data of the FHIR resource are the same. You can convert between JSON and XML representations of FHIR data without loss of information.\nYou should use JSON by default when writing code to ingest in FHIR instances (or computable representations of FHIR profiles or resource definitions).\nWhen requesting FHIR data from a server, you can specify the format of the response.\nIf you work with R, the fhircrackr library uses the XML representation of FHIR resource instances. If you use this library, you will need basic familiarity with XML to extract data elements from the FHIR resource instances.",

    "section": "4 Value in Research FHIR Applications",
    "text": "4 Value in Research FHIR Applications\nCDS Hooks can be implemented in FHIR applications to enhance research capabilities by providing real-time, context-specific decision support within clinical workflow.\n\n4.1 Examples\nHere are some examples of how CDS Hooks can be used in research-oriented FHIR applications:\n\nPatient Enrollment in Clinical Trials: CDS Hooks can trigger alerts for patient eligibility in clinical trials. For instance, when a clinician opens a patient’s record (patient-view hook), the CDS service can identify if the patient meets the inclusion criteria for ongoing trials and notify the clinician, facilitating timely patient recruitment. This prompt could include a link to a SMART on FHIR application that handles consent, eligibility screening, and enrollment processes.\nProtocol Management and Adherence: Research-focused FHIR applications can leverage CDS Hooks to provide context-specific guidance to clinicians. For example, if a CDS Hook identifies that a patient is a potential candidate for a research study based on their clinical data, the associated SMART on FHIR application can provide detailed study information, consent forms, and data collection tools tailored to that specific scenario.\nPopulation Health and Surveillance: CDS Hooks can be used in public health surveillance by identifying and reporting cases of notifiable diseases. For example, when a clinician orders a diagnostic test for an infectious disease (order-select hook), the CDS service can alert the clinician about reporting requirements and facilitate the automatic submission of relevant data to public health databases.\nEnhanced Patient Data Access and Integration: CDS Hooks facilitate access to real-time clinical data by triggering actions based on specific clinical events. This is particularly valuable in research settings where up-to-date data is crucial. For example, a research FHIR application could use CDS Hooks to automatically collect and analyze data from pregnant diabetic patients, as soon as their condition is recorded in the EHR.\n\nAn example of a research-focused application leveraging CDS Hooks can be found here: Automated Clinical Trial Cohort Definition and Evaluation with CQL and CDS-Hooks [sic].\nBy integrating CDS Hooks into FHIR applications, researchers can create tools that not only enhance data collection and analysis but also improve patient engagement and streamline research workflows. This integration is particularly valuable in clinical research, where timely and accurate data are essential for producing high-quality evidence.\n\n\n4.2 CDS Hooks Key Features\nCDS Hooks offer a powerful framework for integrating CDS into healthcare workflows through FHIR-based applications. They provide a flexible and standardized approach for delivering context-specific guidance, information, and actions directly within EHRs and other clinical systems.\nThe following diagram illustrates the basic workflow of CDS Hooks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    accTitle: Diagram showing the workflow for CDS Hooks\n    participant EHR\n    participant CDS Service\n    participant FHIR Server\n\n    EHR-&gt;&gt;CDS Service: Hook (e.g., patient-view)\n    CDS Service-&gt;&gt;FHIR Server: Request patient data\n    FHIR Server--&gt;&gt;CDS Service: Return FHIR resources\n    CDS Service-&gt;&gt;CDS Service: Process data and generate recommendations\n    CDS Service--&gt;&gt;EHR: Return CDS Cards\n    EHR-&gt;&gt;EHR: Display Cards to user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EHR triggers a hook (e.g., when opening a patient’s record).\nThe CDS Service receives the hook and requests relevant patient data from the FHIR Server.\nThe FHIR Server returns the requested data as FHIR resources.\nThe CDS Service processes the data and generates recommendations.\nThe CDS Service returns CDS Cards to the EHR.\nThe EHR displays the Cards to the user.\n\nBelow are key features and functions of CDS Hooks that enable key capabilities such as event-driven triggers, contextual awareness, and actionable recommendations.\n\n1. CDS Hooks\n\nDefinition: The idea behind CDS Hooks is to “hook into” specific moments in the clinician’s workflow (called hooks) and trigger decision support services that can provide actionable insights, recommendations, or alerts. Hooks can be triggered by when a user opens a patient’s electronic health record (patient-view hook), when an order is selected (order-select hook), when an order is signed (order-sign hook), when a patient encounter or visit begins (encounter-start hook), etc.\nFurther information: A more detailed overview on hooks and examples of hook types can be found at the section on Types of CDS Hooks.\n\n\n\n2. CDS Services\n\nDefinition: A CDS Service is a web service that is triggered by a specific CDS Hook and provides decision support in response. It processes the clinical context provided by the EHR (or “CDS Client”) and returns actionable information in the form of CDS Cards.\nRole: CDS Services act as the “brains” behind the decision support, analyzing clinical data and applying rules, guidelines, or algorithms to generate relevant recommendations or insights.\nWorkflow:\n\nHook Trigger: The EHR triggers a hook event and sends a request to the CDS Service with relevant patient context.\nProcessing: The CDS Service processes the request, potentially querying additional data, and applies clinical logic.\nResponse: The CDS Service returns CDS Cards containing recommendations, information, or links to further resources.\n\n\n\n\n3. CDS Cards\n\nDefinition: CDS Cards are the user interface components presented to clinicians within the EHR. They deliver the decision support recommendations generated by the CDS Service in a format that is easy for clinicians to review and act upon. A CDS service can return any combination of CDS Cards in response to a hook, enabling a user to see content integrated into clinical workflows that provides decision support at point-of-care.\nTypes of Cards:\n\nInformation Cards: Provide general information related to the patient or clinical scenario, such as educational content or guidelines.\nSuggestion Cards: Offer actionable recommendations, such as changing a medication, ordering a test, or following a care pathway. These cards often include buttons for quick actions.\nApp Link Cards: Include links to reference materials or for launching additional applications or tools that provide deeper analysis or further decision support.\n\n\n\n\n4. CDS Prefetch\n\nDefinition: Prefetch is a mechanism that allows the EHR to pre-load specific FHIR resources and send them to the CDS service when triggering a hook. This optimizes performance by reducing the need for the CDS service to query the EHR for data during the execution of the hook, enabling quicker decision support.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 CDS Hooks Framework Overview & Capabilities\nTo recap, the CDS Hooks framework enables the integration of clinical decision support (CDS) into a clinician’s workflow by “hooking into” specific moments during patient care. When a clinical event, known as a hook (e.g., opening a patient’s chart or prescribing medication), occurs within an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, the CDS Hooks framework triggers a CDS Service. This service analyzes the context of the event, applies relevant clinical rules or guidelines, and responds with CDS Cards that provide actionable insights, recommendations, or educational content directly within the EHR.",

This scalability makes it applicable across various clinical scenarios and healthcare environments.\nActionable and Interactive Decision Support: CDS Cards presented to clinicians are designed to be concise and actionable, with interactive elements like buttons and links that enable quick decisions or further exploration of the provided information.\n\nWhile the CDS Hooks frameworks provides considerable capabilities to enhance clinical decision support in applications, poor design can lead to alert fatigue and other drawbacks that may detract from the intended impacts of an application. Therefore, following best practices in user-centered design is important when using CDS Hooks. Key considerations include:\n\nEnsuring the reliability and accuracy of CDS recommendations\nManaging the risk of alert fatigue by carefully curating the frequency and relevance of alerts\nAddressing privacy and security concerns when sharing data with external services\nValidating the clinical impact of CDS interventions to ensure they positively influence patient outcomes\n\nIn summary, CDS Hooks provide a robust framework for integrating clinical decision support into healthcare workflows, offering event-driven, contextually aware, actionable recommendations. Their integration with SMART on FHIR applications and their scalability and customization make them a valuable tool for both clinical and research applications.",

    "text": "1 High-level technical considerations\n\n1.1 Authorization pattern\nAuthorization ensures that the user of an application has permission to perform specific actions. For SMART-on-FHIR applications, it ensures the user is allowed to access the FHIR data they are requesting.\nYour SMART on FHIR application will use one of the authorization patterns defined by the SMART App Launch specification.\n\nSMART App Launch supports applications that launch in an EHR or launch standalone:\n\nEHR Launch: A user launches the application within the EHR from an existing EHR session (e.g., custom a clinical decision support application).\nStandalone Launch: A user launches the application directly, like in a smartphone or stand-alone website (e.g., Apple’s Health app on the iPhone).\n\nSMART Backend Services support applications that run autonomously, like an automated data pipeline. SMART Backend Services are also used for user-facing applications where the FHIR authorization service does not need the user’s information (e.g., a dashboard application).\n\n\n\n1.2 Software libraries\nOpen-source libraries exist in many programming languages to help developers work with FHIR data and SMART App Launch.\ndocs.smarthealthit.org lists the following software libraries that support SMART App Launch:\n\n\nJavaScript or TypeScript: Client-side and server-side library with support for SMART App Launch\nNode.js from Vermonster: An alternative Node.js implementation\nPython: Server-side Python library with support for SMART App Launch\nR\nRuby\nSwift (iOS)\nJava\n.NET: FHIR client library from Firely\n\n\nHL7®’s Confluence site also has a list of FHIR-related software libraries.\nYou can create a SMART on FHIR application without relying on third-party libraries, but using a third-party library will likely save development time.\n\n\n1.3 Security and privacy\nFHIR servers will likely return health data that can be linked to an individual. If so, rules around handling Protected Health Information (PHI) apply. Your institution’s IRB will also have policies for handling sensitive patient data used in research.\nDetermine the security and privacy approach for health data early in your design process before working with any real patient data. You can use synthetic data and a test FHIR server during development and testing.\n\n\n1.4 Human-centered design\nIf you are developing a user-facing application, consider a human-centered design approach. From ISO 9241-210:2019:\n\nHuman-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.\n\nFor more information on human-centered design in healthcare research, see Göttgens and Oertelt-Prigione (2021).",

    "text": "2 Example SMART on FHIR app\nFollow the steps below to create a simple browser-based SMART on FHIR app (based on this tutorial) using JavaScript. This example will use SMART App Launch’s EHR Launch flow.\n\n2.1 Prerequisites\nYou need:\n\na text editor\na way to run a local HTTP server (described below)\nfamiliarity with HTML, JavaScript, and the command line\n\n\n\n2.2 Instructions\nBelow are the instructions for getting an example SMART on FHIR app running locally. We provide a detailed explanation of how this works after the instructions.\n\nStep 1: Create a project folder and files\nCreate a folder with two files:\n\nlaunch.html\nindex.html\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create the launch page\nAdd the following content to launch.html:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Launch My APP&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Use the SMART on FHIR JavaScript library to handle authorization --&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            FHIR.oauth2.authorize({\n\n              // The client_id that you should have obtained after registering a client at\n              // the EHR.\n              //\n              // Note that this can be an arbitrary string when testing with\n              // http://launch.smarthealthit.org.\n              clientId: \"my_web_app\",\n\n              // The scopes that you request from the EHR. In this case we want to:\n              // launch            - Get the launch context\n              // openid & fhirUser - Get the current user\n              // patient/*.read    - Read patient data\n              scope: \"launch openid fhirUser patient/*.read\",\n\n              // Typically, if your redirectUri points to the root of the current directory\n              // (where the launchUri is), you can omit this option because the default value is\n              // \".\". However, some servers do not support directory indexes so \".\" and \"./\"\n              // will not automatically map to the \"index.html\" file in that directory.\n              redirectUri: \"index.html\"\n            });\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nNote that the FHIR.oauth2.authorize() method will automatically redirect back to the authorization server (launch.smarthealthit.org for this example). This means that you will never see this page rendered in your browser.\n\n\nStep 3: Create the “app” page\nAdd the following contents to index.html. This will be the testing “app” for this example:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Example SMART App&lt;/title&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use the SMART on FHIR JavaScript library --&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use Bootstrap for styling --&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;\n            /* Additional styling for text boxes that will show JSON data */\n            #patient, #meds {\n                font-family: Monaco, monospace;\n                white-space: pre;\n                font-size: 13px;\n                height: 38vh;\n                overflow: scroll;\n                border: 1px solid #CCC;\n            }\n        &lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;nav class=\"navbar bg-primary\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2vh\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"navbar-brand mb-0 h1 text-white\"&gt;Example SMART on FHIR Application&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/nav&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Current Patient&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"patient\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;br/&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Medications&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"meds\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n                FHIR.oauth2.ready().then(function(client) {\n\n                    // Render the current patient (or any error)\n                    client.patient.read().then(\n                        function(pt) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = JSON.stringify(pt, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n\n                    // Get MedicationRequests for the selected patient\n                    client.request(\"/MedicationRequest?patient=\" + client.patient.id, {\n                        resolveReferences: [ \"medicationReference\" ],\n                        graph: true\n                    })\n\n                    // Reject if no MedicationRequests are found\n                    .then(function(data) {\n                        if (!data.entry || !data.entry.length) {\n                            throw new Error(\"No medications found for the selected patient\");\n                        }\n                        return data.entry;\n                    })\n\n\n                    // Render the current patient's medications (or any error)\n                    .then(\n                        function(meds) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = JSON.stringify(meds, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n\n                }).catch(console.error);\n            &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\nStep 4: Run a local web server\n\nOpen a command prompt window and go to the folder you created.\nRun a command to start a local web server on port 8000. For example, if you have Python 3 on your system run:\npython3 -m http.server 8000\nFor Python 2, run:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nFor more information on using Python as a local web server, review Mozilla’s test server guide. If you don’t have Python, you can use Ruby or a Node package.\nOnce you are running the server, navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see a page that looks like this:\n\nNote: data will not load by opening index.html in your browser. To load data, you must go through the EHR launch flow (see next step).\n\n\nStep 5: Test with launch.smarthealthit.org\nGo to https://launch.smarthealthit.org, enter http://localhost:8000/launch.html for in the “App’s Launch URL” field, and click “Launch”.\nYou should see the following happen:\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n2.3 App launch process explanation\nHere’s a visual diagram of the process that occurs when you launch your example application with launch.smarthealthit.org:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    accTitle: Diagram showing the workflow for a SMART on FHIR EHR launch\n    %%{init:{'sequence':{'messageFontSize': 30, 'actorFontSize': 30}}}%%\n    participant A as localhost:8000/launch.html\n    participant B as launch.smarthealthit.org\n    participant C as localhost:8000/index.html\n    participant D as FHIR Server\n\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Launch triggered via test website\n    B -&gt;&gt; A: Launch requested\n    A -&gt;&gt; B: Authorization request\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Dummy provider log-in and patient selection\n    B -&gt;&gt; C: Authorization granted\n    C -&gt;&gt; B: Access token request\n    B --&gt;&gt; C: Access token response\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request Patient\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with Patient JSON\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request MedicationRequests\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with MedicationRequest JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the details of this process:\n\nYou trigger the application launch by clicking “Launch” on launch.smarthealthit.org. This simulates an EHR user triggering a SMART on FHIR app launch using a link in the EHR.\nIn this case, launch.smarthealthit.org redirects your browser to http://localhost:8000/launch.html?iss=http%3A%2F%2Flaunch.smarthealthit.org%2Fv%2Fr4%2Ffhir&launch=....\nThe SMART App Launch documentation explains the two parameters in this URL:\n\n\niss: Identifies the EHR’s FHIR endpoint, which the app can use to obtain additional details about the EHR including its authorization URL.\nlaunch: Opaque identifier for this specific launch and any EHR context associated with it. This parameter must be communicated back to the EHR at authorization time.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/launch.html loads in your browser, and FHIR.oauth2.authorize() is called with the options defined in launch.html’s source code. The authorize() method obtains an authorization code from the testing server’s “authorize” endpoint. In this case, it does this by triggering a browser redirect to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/authorize with a number of parameters.\nYour browser loads a page on the launch.smarthealthit.org server simulating provider log-in and patient selection. (Note: If this application was being used in a real-world EHR, the provider would be logged in through the EHR and the selected patient would be whichever patient the provider was viewing when they launched the app in the EHR.)\nThis dummy flow gathers the information needed for launch.smarthealthit.org to provide the example application with the authorization code. It does this by redirecting your browser to http://localhost:8000/index.html?code=...&state=.... It knows to take you to http://localhost:8000/index.html because you specified the parameter redirectUri: \"index.html\" in the source code of launch.html.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html loads in your browser and calls FHIR.oauth2.ready(). This creates a Client instance that handles obtaining and refreshing the OAuth access token needed to authorize access to the FHIR server, and making requests to the FHIR server with the proper headers.\nIn this case, a call is made to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/token, which responds with the authorization token that must be passed along with any requests for FHIR data.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.patient.read() to request the Patient resource instance from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/Patient/39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the read() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.request(...) to request the MedicationRequest resource instances from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/MedicationRequest?patient=39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the request() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\n\nNow that the application has access to FHIR data, common front-end web development techniques could be used to create an application that utilizes this data.\nThis example assumes a SMART on FHIR-enabled server (like the https://launch.smarthealthit.org testing server used above). See this tutorial for more information on setting up a SMART on FHIR-enabled server.\nAdditionally, Cerner’s browser-based app tutorial provides more detail on setting up a browser-based SMART on FHIR application.",

Responsible for moving projects and draft changes to production. Limited to 2-3 staff members.\nProject developer administrator: Clinical REDCap staff responsible for creating REDCap projects and associated forms or surveys. Leads project validation to be carried out in collaboration with clinical stakeholders.\nService administrator: Specialized account for managing secure services post data collection (e.g., application programming interface data export to electronic health record).\nClinical data lead: Clinical staff responsible for monitoring the integrity of the data, providing clinic-specific training to clinic users, supporting minor technical issues in the clinic, facilitating project validation, submitting project change requests, approving subordinate account requests, and serving as the main point of contact for developers and administrators.\nClinical care provider: Clinical staff responsible for the administration and review of clinical assessments; can enter data that have been collected on paper into REDCap.\nClinical assistant: Clinical support staff responsible for administering patient survey queue in the clinic and providing simple technical assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, for REDCap on FHIR, close collaboration with the EHR implementation team and informaticists who are familiar with your institution’s EHR is necessary.\nMaré et al. (2022) focused on the adoption of REDCap in academic and clinical environments identified similar roles and strategies to facilitate the process. They identified the following methods to support new REDCap users, listed below. Again, these are not specific to REDCap on FHIR but are still applicable.\n\n\ntop-down organizational support;\nsecure and reliable application, hosting infrastructure, and systems administration; an enabling and accessible REDCap support team;\nregular hands-on training workshops covering REDCap project setup and data collection instrument design techniques;\nannual local symposia to promote networking and awareness of all the latest software features and best practices for using them;\nparticipation in REDCap Consortium activities;\nand regular and ongoing mentorship from members of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\n\nThe authors also used two strategies to support adoption of REDCap:\n\nBuilding trust among researchers in the security and reliability of REDCap through several layers of back-up should any component fail and simulated data loss and retrieval exercises.\nEstablishing a REDCap administrator that acted as a dedicated, go-to person that could answer researchers’ questions and offer consultations.",

Many EHRs–including those from Cerner, Epic, and MEDITECH–support SMART on FHIR applications.

    "text": "1 Research use cases\n\n1.1 Integrating with an EHR\nResearchers primarily use SMART on FHIR to integrate with an EHR. For example, several researchers have trialed new clinical decision support (CDS) systems using SMART on FHIR. They use SMART on FHIR to integrate their CDS tool into EHRs without modifying the EHRs and without creating unique versions for each EHR vendor.\nTarumi et al. (2021) used this approach to show that an AI-driven CDS could integrate with Epic via SMART on FHIR, and Curran et al. (2020) used this approach to prototype a CDS system for chronic disease management.\n\n\n1.2 Adding data to an EHR workflow\nResearchers also use SMART on FHIR to add data to EHR workflows. For example, a patient may use a web or smartphone app to report their outcomes data. A SMART on FHIR application can make this data accessible from an EHR (Wesley et al. 2021).\nSMART on FHIR can also help researchers integrate data into an EHR that the EHR does not natively support. For example, Watkins and Eilbeck (2020) discuss how genetic testing could be better-integrated with EHRs using SMART on FHIR and CDS Hooks (see below).\n\n\n1.3 Accessing bulk data\nSMART on FHIR facilitated Bulk Data Access (see below) may provide a new way for researchers to access population-level data. A researcher may want to gather population data from multiple institutions that do not store their data using a shared common data model. However, if these EHRs use FHIR, they likely use the widely implemented US Core FHIR Implementation Guide. SMART on FHIR with Bulk Data Access would enable researchers to access the data as US Core-conforming FHIR resource instances across these institutions.\nNote, SMART on FHIR used for Bulk Data Access is relatively new and has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed research publications.\n\n\n1.4 SMART on FHIR app gallary\nThe SMART App Gallery lists a number of SMART on FHIR applications, which may provide additional ideas on how SMART on FHIR could be used for research."

    "text": "3 Related technologies\n\n3.1 Bulk Data Access\nThe Bulk Data Access standard enables researchers to retrieve large volumes of data from a patient population in an EHR. For example, “a health system may want to periodically retrieve updated clinical data from an EHR to a research database.”\nHL7® first released the Bulk Data Access standard in 2019 and released v2 in November 2022.\nMany EHR vendors, including Allscripts, Athena Health, Cerner, and Epic, have adopted this standard. In January 2023, ONC announced its support for this standard.\nThe Bulk Data Access standard is part of the SMART ecosystem, and SMART on FHIR can be used to authenticate and authorize applications that retrieve bulk data automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see this overview presentation and the HL7 specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 CDS Hooks\nCDS Hooks is an HL7 standard that can support SMART on FHIR application integration with EHRs. HL7 released CDS Hooks v2 in August 2022.\nCDS Hooks allows an action in an EHR to trigger an action in a third-party application. Thiess et al. (2022) writes:\n\nTo make CDS accessible when it is needed, the standard defines several hooks that occur through clinicians interacting with the EHR. For example, the patient-view hook is triggered when the patient record is opened, or the order-select hook is triggered when the prescriber selects an order (e.g., medication or procedure).\n\nThe standard includes ways for the third-party application to get contextual information related to the hook, like the patient data being viewed. The application can then send information back to the EHR. Thiess et al. (2022) continues:\n\nThe CDS Hooks service provides a response in the form of a “Card” that is displayed inside the EHR. There are three types of cards: (i) information cards provide patient-specific information, such as an assessment or reference information; (ii) suggestion cards provide a recommended action (e.g., an order) in a FHIR resource; and (iii) app cards provide a link to launch a SMART on FHIR app.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nMorgan et al. (2022) demonstrate that CDS Hooks can increase utilization of SMART on FHIR applications.\nStrasberg et al. (2021) describes additional background information on how CDS Hooks function.\nThiess et al. (2022) provides more details on how CDS Hooks can be integrated with an EHR and a SMART on FHIR application."

    "text": "4 Implementation considerations\nIf you have a research use case that is a good fit with SMART on FHIR, you will likely work with a software engineer and your institution’s IT experts to investigate integrating with the relevant EHR(s). If your institution has staff with experience integrating SMART on FHIR applications, consult with them early when developing your research approach.\nSMART on FHIR applications that integrate with an EHR’s user interface via SMART App Launch are often web applications. SMART on FHIR applications that run without being triggered by user input in an EHR, including applications that use Bulk Data Access, are often backend services.\nIntegrating SMART on FHIR backend applications with EHRs is often less complex than integrating SMART on FHIR web applications. However, in both cases, there may be EHR-specific requirements including administrative approval.\nAlso, consider security and privacy early when developing your research approach. Take steps to ensure proper data storage and access as you would with any software that handles sensitive data. In addition to IRB approval, you may need approval related to privacy and information security. If your institution has not worked with SMART on FHIR before, it may not have a well-defined process for getting the appropriate approvals. In this case, it may be helpful to identify researchers from other institutions who have used SMART on FHIR in a similar context, and cite their work to demonstrate prior successful use of this technology when discussing with the IRB and decision-makers at your institution.\nPlease see SMART on FHIR Technical Details for more technical implementation on using SMART on FHIR and related standards."

    "section": "1 Modules",
    "text": "1 Modules\nBy default, Synthea includes dozens of modules representing the progression and treatment of common diseases and determinants of health. Synthea modules are either top-level modules, also referred to as core modules, which will run for every patient in the simulation starting at birth, or submodules, which are only run when specifically invoked from another module via a specific state. The set of modules is not fixed; users can create, edit, or delete modules as needed.\nThere are three fundamental concepts involved in the modules:\n\nStates, which can be broken down further into:\n\nClinical States, which represent events related to the patient’s health care. A clinical state will nearly always result in one or more entries being added to the patient’s record.\nControl States, which drive the progression and flow through the module. For example, delays and guards will pause the module for some amount of time.\n\nTransitions, which represent the connections between states. States may transition directly to another state, or they may branch to multiple states, where the path the patient takes may vary based on different logical conditions or weighted random chance.\nLogical Conditions, which are tests against aspects of the patient, their health record, or their path through the modules, which can be “true” or “false”.\n\nThe Synthea wiki details all of the available options for States, Transitions, and Logical Conditions.\nDuring the generation process, Synthea will process each module individually, one state at a time. States will process and transition to the next state immediately, with the following exceptions:\n\nTerminal states represent the end of the module.\nDelay states, where the module will continue only after the specified amount of time has passed.\nGuard states, where the module will continue only after the given logical condition becomes true.\nEncounter states of type “wellness”, where the module will determine when to enter the encounter using a schedule based on the patient’s age and current symptoms.\n\n\n1.1 Creating and Editing Modules\nFor the most detailed and up-to-date guidance on creating and editing modules, see the Generic Module Framework section on the Synthea wiki.\nWhile the module JSONs can technically be written by hand, we strongly recommend using the Module Builder to edit modules graphically.\nBefore starting with the module builder, we recommend watching a short video introduction to the Module Builder, and reading through a module builder tutorial on the Synthea Wiki.\n\n\n1.2 Creating a New Module\nIn the Module Builder, click the “New Module” button in the upper left. This will open a new tab in the builder with the simplest possible module: an Initial state that transitions directly to a Terminal state.\n\nEither state can be clicked on to select it and change the name, type, transition, or other properties via the sidebar. As you familiarize yourself with the module builder, try clicking on the various fields to see what options are available. No changes here can directly affect Synthea, so don’t worry, it is completely impossible to break anything (though it is possible to lose work, so we recommend downloading work-in-progress modules to a file often). If you make a mistake, nearly any change can be undone with the Undo button.\nTo add new states to the module, click the “+ Add State” button in the upper right of the editor. Note this will do slightly different things based on what is currently selected in the module graph:\n\nIf nothing is selected, the new state will be added off to the side. You must manually connect other states to it, and it to other states by editing the transitions.\nIf a state is selected, the new state will be added “at the end” of the selected state. The selected state will now transition directly to the new state, and the new state will have the original transition from the selected state.\nIf a transition arrow is selected, the new state will be added “inside” the transition. The transition will now point to the new state, and the new state will transition directly to the original target of the transition.\n\nAgain, the new state can be clicked on to select it and change the name, type, transition, or other properties via the sidebar. Different options and fields will appear depending on the state and transition type selected.\n\n\n1.3 Editing an Existing Module\nTo load an existing module for editing, first click the “Open Module” button at the top of the Module Builder. From the load module screen there are a few options:\n\nThe “Core Modules” and “Submodules” are a good first step for exploring the various modules available.\nThe “GitHub modules” tab loads modules directly from various branches on the core Synthea repository on GitHub.\nYou can also drag & drop a module JSON file onto the modal, click to open a file browser to select a JSON file, or paste the JSON content of the file into the “Paste JSON” tab.\nThe “Local Storage” and “My Modules” tabs will be empty initially, but as you use the module builder these may be populated with modules you edit.\n\nOnce a module is loaded, you can add, edit, or remove states just as you would if you were creating a new module. Note that no matter how you load a module into the module builder, you are editing a copy. As before, this means you should feel free to experiment without worrying about breaking anything, but do download your module regularly to make sure you don’t lose work if something goes wrong.\n\n\n1.4 Loading Modules Into Synthea\nTop-level modules in Synthea are stored in the src/main/resources/modules folder under the base synthea directory. Submodules are stored in further subfolders under this. If your new or modified module is a top-level module and is expected to run for all patients starting at birth, make sure it is in the src/main/resources/modules folder. If you are modifying an existing module, make sure the name is exactly the same (in terms of capitalization, spaces vs underscores, etc) and you completely replace the file in its original location.\nOnce your module has been loaded, no special command line flags are necessary. Simply re-run Synthea with your desired configuration and it should pick up the new module immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Issues / Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI created a module with just a Condition/Observation/Procedure but it doesn’t show up in records. Why not?\n\nMost likely the issue is that the state is being processed and the record entry is added immediately at birth, but then filtered out at export time. By default Synthea only keeps the last 10 years of history when a patient is exported. This setting is driven by the configuration item exporter.years_of_history. This setting can be changed either on the command line with flag --exporter.years_of_history=N or if using the developer setup, in the configuration file at src/main/resources/synthea.properties. We recommend setting this option to 0, meaning “keep all history”, while creating and debugging a new module.\n\nWhy isn’t Synthea processing my module?\n\nFirst, make sure you are not encountering the same issue as the previous question, where your module is being processed but the record entries are filtered out. Next, make sure the module is actually being loaded - watch the list of modules being loaded at startup and confirm your new module is in that list. It may be useful to temporarily remove other modules to speed up the process.\n\nHow can I run only my module and none of the default modules?\n\nGenerally this is not recommended as there are dependencies between modules which may be non-obvious and removing some can result in unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes. Also note that some of the modules are included as part of the core engine and cannot be easily disabled. However if for debugging purposes you would like to disable the default modules, the best approach is to remove the files from src/main/resources/modules (or move them somewhere else).\n\n\nIf your module still does not work as expected, please feel free to post a discussion item on the Synthea GitHub to request assistance. Make sure to include as much information as possible, including the module and any errors you are seeing.",

    "section": "2 Keep Modules",
    "text": "2 Keep Modules\nIt is common in many use cases that only records with specific attributes are relevant, for example, maybe you only want records containing a certain diagnosed Condition. There are a few approaches that can be taken here:\n\nPost-process the data with another tool such as a Python script, to examine a set of exported records and filter out those that do not meet your defined criteria. (Note that if the condition of interest is rare, it may take a lot of time and resources to generate sufficient records)\nModify the module for your condition of interest, to ensure all patients get the condition. (Note this may be trivial in some instances, but in others the relationships between modules can be complex, or the item of interest may be set within the Java engine.)\nUse a Keep Module. A Keep Module is a module similar to a disease module, that defines criteria for whether a record should be kept or discarded. The biggest advantage of a Keep Module is that all patients exported will have the desired criteria, and it will generate the requested number of patients. (That is, assuming the criteria are possible to meet.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is critical that the Keep Module represent logic that it is possible for a Synthea record to actually meet. For instance, the Diabetes module will never onset diabetes in a patient earlier than age 18, so a Keep Module for “keep patients under 18 with Diabetes” will not work.\nSynthea does not have the ability to recognize when a Keep Module is impossible to satisfy. In these situations, to avoid running forever, the simulation will stop after a certain number of failed attempts to generate a record. If the situation is known to be possible but exceptionally rare, it is possible to increase the number of failed attempts before the simulation stops, with the config setting: generate.max_attempts_to_keep_patient = 1000\n\n\nThe basic idea of a Keep Module is that it is a regular Synthea module, built with the Module Builder, with a specially named Terminal state “Keep”. The module should use conditional transitions with logic such as “Active Condition” to determine whether to send patients to the Keep state or not. Patients that end the module in the Keep state will be exported, patients that end the module in any other state will be discarded and Synthea will restart a new patient with the same demographics but a different seed.\n\nConstruct a Keep Module using the Module Builder as usual (see instruction above in Creating and Editing Modules ), but do not save the .json file to the src/main/resources/modules folder. The easiest place to store it is in the base synthea folder.\nFinally to actually run Synthea with the Keep Module, use the -k flag with the path to the file, for example:\nrun_synthea -k must_have_diabetes.json\nNow patients exported to any output format will only be patients matching the defined criteria from the Keep Module.\nNote that only one Keep Module may be used at a time, however the logic within it can be as complex as you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you only need patients with some active clinical criteria, such as Conditions or Medications, the Synthea Toolkit contains a minimal editor for creating this type of simple Keep Module quickly. For anything more complex, use the full Module Builder instead.\n\n\nMore information on Keep Modules is available on the Synthea wiki.",

A set of demographics files and other geographical information is available for many countries at the synthea-international repository.\nBeyond just other countries, the same approach can be use to create demographics files representing any population of interest. For research purposes, the most common changes are likely to be to the demographics of the desired population.\nFor instance, a research effort may want patients with a particular age and racial distribution. One approach to generate a population in Synthea with a specific demographic mix is to identify a city or state with the desired characteristics and generate a population in that location. Alternatively, if there is no such city or state, one could create or modify the demographics file so that it contains a line for a location with the desired characteristics. The default demographics file is available at ./src/main/resources/geography/demographics.csv - this file may be modified directly, or you may point Synthea at an alternative demographics file with the configuration property generate.demographics.default_file. Details on the demographics file format are available on the Synthea wiki.\nOther types of information which can be modified or replaced to meet various needs are zip codes, time zones, providers, names, and costs.\nFull details for customizing Synthea to generate other areas are available on the Synthea wiki.",

This makes it suitable for use with the Basic setup of Synthea.\nModule overrides are defined using a Java properties file, where each key is the path to a specific field within a module, and the value is the new value to set for that field.\n(module file path)\\:\\:(json path to value) = (new value)\nFor instance, to change the prevalence of Appendicitis among males from the default 8.6% to 100% (imagine an example use case of “a population of all patients who have had an appendectomy”), you could use an override file containing the following line:\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Male']['distributed_transition'][0]['distribution'] = 1.0\nThis sequence of field names and indices uniquely identifies the field in the module JSON, and corresponds to setting the highlighted transition on the Appendicitis module to 100%: \nAn overrides file may be saved anywhere, but for ease of use we recommend placing it directly in the base synthea folder or a subfolder, with the extension .properties.\nAssuming the file overrides.properties is in the subfolder output, run Synthea as follows:\nrun_synthea --module_override=./output/overrides.properties\nIf using the Developer setup of Synthea, you can generate a template of a module override file with the “overrides” gradle task, for instance:\n./gradlew overrides -PincludeModules=appendicitis.json\nNote: if running on Windows, use .\\gradlew.bat instead of ./gradlew. gradlew here is a reference to the Gradle build tool which Synthea uses.\nThis creates an overrides file at ./output/overrides.properties containing the following:\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Male']['distributed_transition'][0]['distribution'] = 0.086\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Male']['distributed_transition'][1]['distribution'] = 0.914\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Female']['distributed_transition'][0]['distribution'] = 0.067\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Female']['distributed_transition'][1]['distribution'] = 0.933\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Pre_appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][0]['distribution'] = 0.263\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Pre_appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][1]['distribution'] = 0.423\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Pre_appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][2]['distribution'] = 0.221\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Pre_appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][3]['distribution'] = 0.093\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][0]['distribution'] = 0.7\nappendicitis.json\\:\\:$['states']['Appendicitis']['distributed_transition'][1]['distribution'] = 0.3\nAny lines may be modified, or freely removed if the field value is not meant to change.\nMore detail on creating and using overrides files is available on the Synthea wiki.",

    "text": "5 Flexporter\nThe Flexible Exporter, aka “Flexporter” is an experimental feature that allows for arbitrary customizations in Synthea.\nThe Flexporter works using a YAML-based mapping file to define transformations that are applied to each patient record. Transformations generally contain a location, represented in FHIRPath, and a value to put at that location.\nAs with other customization features built into Synthea, the Flexporter is intended to tweak Synthea data, not radically transform it. Common situations where the Flexporter will be most valuable are situations where specific fields or resource types are needed but not exported. (For instance, imagine a use case that requires an Appointment resource prior to every Encounter. Synthea out of the box supports Encounter resources but not Appointment.) The Flexporter is intended to support a number of different use cases, but since it is impossible to predict every possible use case in advance, there are things that are outside the capability of the Flexporter.\nAs of June 2023, the Flexporter supports the following types of actions:\n\napply_profiles: Adds a given profile URI to the meta.profile field on resources matching the given FHIRPath\nset_values: Set values on fields on resources that already exist within the Bundle\ncreate_resource: Create new resources with specific values and add them to the Bundle.\nkeep_resources: Keep only resources matching certain FHIRPath. Other resources will be filtered out\ndelete_resources: Delete resources matching certain FHIRPath.\nexecute_script: Execute arbitrary JavaScript against either the entire Bundle or against individual resources of specific types. Note that the provided JavaScript may be arbitrarily complex, but loading libraries such as from npm is not supported.\n\nSample Flexporter Mapping File:\n---\n# name is just a friendly name for this mapping\nname: Random Testing\n\n# applicability determines whether this mapping applies to a given patient record\napplicability: true\n\nactions:\n - name: Set Immunization.recorded = Immunization.occurrenceDateTime\n   set_values:\n     - applicability: Immunization\n       fields:\n         - location: Immunization.recorded\n           value: $getField([Immunization.occurrence])\n\n\n - name: Create ServiceRequest for every Procedure\n   create_resource:\n     - resourceType: ServiceRequest\n       based_on:\n         resource: Procedure\n       fields:\n         - location: ServiceRequest.intent\n           value: plan\n         - location: ServiceRequest.encounter.reference\n           value: $getField([Procedure.encounter.reference])\n         - location: ServiceRequest.subject.reference\n           value: $findRef([Patient])\n         - location: ServiceRequest.code\n           value: $getField([Procedure.code])\n\n       writeback:\n         - location: Procedure.basedOn.reference\n           value: $setRef([ServiceRequest])\nThis example mapping does the following:\n\nFor every instance of Immunization:\n\n\nCopy the value from Immunization.occurrence[x] (note as of April 2023 in Synthea this will always be a dateTime) into the field Immunization.recorded\n\n\nFor every instance of Procedure:\n\n\nCreate a new instance of ServiceRequest and add it to the Bundle.\nSet the following values on the created ServiceRequest:\n\nSet ServiceRequest.intent to the fixed value “plan”\nCopy the value from the source Procedure.encounter.reference into the field ServiceRequest.encounter.reference\nFind the first resource matching Patient in the Bundle, create a reference to it, and set that on the field ServiceRequest.subject.reference\nCopy the value from the source Procedure.code into the field ServiceRequest.code\n\nSet the following values on the source Procedure:\n\nCreate a reference to the created ServiceRequest and set that on the field Procedure.basedOn.reference\n\n\nBecause the Flexporter is still experimental, to use it you must be working off the flexporter branch of the Synthea repository.\nTo run Synthea with Flexporter mappings enabled, use the -fm flag to specify a path to a mapping file. Multiple Flexporter mappings may be used at the same time, in which case they will be applied in the order listed in the command, for example:\nrun_synthea -fm ./src/test/resources/flexporter/qicore_common.yaml -fm additional_fields.yaml`\nFull detail on the mapping file specification and using the Flexporter is available on the Synthea wiki",

    "title": "Running Synthea",
    "section": "4 Configuration",
    "text": "4 Configuration\nSynthea includes a variety of command-line arguments and configuration options to enable or disable common settings, or change certain aspects of the output data. A small subset of the common options are listed below; more complete documentation is available on the Synthea wiki.\n\n4.1 Command line arguments\nSynthea includes a number of settings that can be toggled from the command line. All command line arguments are optional, and if not specified the settings have sensible defaults. Most arguments start with a hyphen and a letter, usually followed by a space and then the desired value for that setting. The first argument that does not start with a hyphen is selected as the US state to generate a population for. The last argument that does not start with a hyphen is selected as the city within the selected state to generate the popualtion for.\nThe most common command line arguments are:\nrun_synthea [options] [state [city]]\n[-p populationSize] (number of living patients to produce)\n[-a minAge-MaxAge] (age range of patients to export)\n[-g gender]\n[-s seed] (for randomness / reproducibility -- runs with the same seed should produce the same results)\n[-h] (print usage)\n[--config=option ...] (any configuration option, see \"Configuration Options\" below)\n\nExamples:\nrun_synthea Massachusetts\nrun_synthea Alaska Juneau\nrun_synthea -s 12345\nrun_synthea -p 1000\nrun_synthea -s 987 Washington Seattle\nrun_synthea -s 21 -p 100 Utah \"Salt Lake City\"\nrun_synthea -g M -a 60-65\nrun_synthea -p 10 --exporter.fhir.export=true\nrun_synthea --exporter.baseDirectory=\"./output_tx/\" Texas\nNote: these examples use run_synthea for brevity. If using the Basic setup, use java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar instead.\nAnnotated Example:\nrun_synthea -s 21 -p 100 Utah \"Salt Lake City\"\n\n-s 21 means “seed the random number generator with the number 21”. Runs with the same seed will generate the same population.\n-p 100 means “generate 100 living patients”. (Note the total generated population may exceed 100 if patients die during the simulation before reaching the present day.)\nUtah means generate patients only within the state of Utah.\n\"Salt Lake City\" means generate patients only within Salt Lake City. (Quotes are necessary when command line arguments contain spaces, apostrophes, or other special characters.)\n\n\n\n4.2 Configuration Options\nMany features can be configured using a properties file. The properties file syntax is one setting per line, with format key = value. Some of the most commonly modified settings are shown below.\n\n# Set the folder where exported records will be created.\n# Each export type (e.g., FHIR, CCDA, CSV) will be a subfolder under this:\nexporter.baseDirectory = ./output/\n\n# Set to true to enable the FHIR R4 exporter:\nexporter.fhir.export = true\n\n# Set the number of years of active history to keep from each patient. Default: 10\n# Set to 0 to keep all history from every patient, note this will increase file size significantly.\nexporter.years_of_history = 10\n\n# Set this to only include selected resource types: (e.g. Patient,Condition,Encounter)\nexporter.fhir.included_resources =\n# Set this to exclude certain resource types from export: (e.g. Observation)\nexporter.fhir.excluded_resources =\n\n# Set to false to enable adding numbers to synthetic patient names, to make it more obvious they are not real data.\ngenerate.append_numbers_to_person_names = true\nSynthea includes a default configuration file (if using the Developer setup, this file is at ./src/main/resources/synthea.properties). Each default setting can be individually overridden using a local settings file that is passed to Synthea when it is run with the -c flag:\njava -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -c path/to/settings/file\nAlternatively, individual configuration settings may be modified by a command-line flag. Any command-line argument starting with -- will set the value of a configuration setting, for example (note that when using this approach there should be no spaces between the setting name, equals sign, and setting value):\njava -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar --generate.append_numbers_to_person_names=false\nAdditional information on configuration options can be found on the Synthea wiki.\n\nYou should now feel comfortable with the basics of how to run Synthea to generate synthetic health records. The next section will describe some options for customizing the patients that Synthea produces.",

FHIR-PYrate does this by taking an element from the FHIR-formatted data like Patient.identifier[0].value and converting to an underscore-delimited column name like identifier_0_value. (Note that Patient.identifier has multiple values in the FHIR data, so there are multiple identifier_N_... columns in the DataFrame.)"

The table below defines each Part and provides an example using the LOINC concept a manual count of white blood cells in cerebral spinal fluid specimen with code 806-0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOINC Part\nDefinition\nExample\n\n\n\n\nComponent (Analyte)\nThe substance or entity being measured\nLeukocytes (white blood cells)\n\n\nProperty\nThe characteristic or attribute of the analyte\nNCnc (Number concentration)\n\n\nTime\nThe interval of time over which an observation was made\nPt (Point in time)\n\n\nSystem (Specimen)\nThe specimen or thing upon which the observation was made\nCSF (Cerebral spinal fluid)\n\n\nScale\nHow the observation value is quantified or expressed: quantitative, ordinal, nominal\nQn (Quantitative)\n\n\nMethod\n(Optional) A high-level classification of how the observation was made.

SNOMED CT is often the “answer” for a test or measurement (where LOINC would be the “question”). SNOMED International further details the utility of SNOMED CT as follows:\n\nSNOMED CT:\n\nIs the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world\nIs a resource with comprehensive, scientifically validated clinical content\nEnables consistent representation of clinical content in electronic health records\nIs mapped to other international standards\nIs in use in more than eighty countries\n\n\n\nStructure\nSNOMED CT is comprised of (International, n.d.):\n\nConcepts: Unique clinical meaning with a computer readable code. Can have multiple descriptions.\nDescriptions: Human readable explanation of a concept (what a doctor would read).\nRelationships: Correlation between related concepts, i.e., “synonyms.” Provides computer readable definitions of concepts and supports data searches.\nThere are two main types of relationships in SNOMED CT:\n\nHierarchical relationships establish each SNOMED CT concept as a child of a more general concept. Each concept in SNOMED CT has at least one hierarchical relationship. For example, 840533007 (SARS-CoV-2) has an is a relationship with its parent, 415360003 (SARS coronavirus), which in turn is a 868196001 (Subgenus Sarbecovirus).\nAttribute relationships define non-hierarchical relationships between two concepts. Concepts can have as many attribute relationships as needed. For example, 399150003 (PCR test for SARS) has a Component relationship with 415360003 (SARS coronavirus).3\n\n\nBelow is an example of how SNOMED might represent a condition (acute post-streptococcal glomerulenephritis) and its associated relationships:4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart BT\n    accTitle: Diagram showing how an example SNOMED CT concept (413643004 \"Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, group\") is related to other SNOMED CT concepts.\n    A{{SNOMED - CT Concept}}\n    B[Clinical Finding\\n404684003]\n    C[Body Structure\\n123037004]\n    D[Both Kidneys\\n17373004]\n    E[Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\\n68544003]\n    F[Organism\\n410607006]\n    G[Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, group A\\n413643004]\n\n    B --&gt; |is a|A\n    F --&gt; |is a|A\n    F --&gt; |is a|B\n    G --&gt; |is a|F\n    G --&gt; |Causative agent|E\n    E --&gt; |Finding site|D\n    D --&gt; |is a|C\n    C --&gt; |is a|B\n    C --&gt; |is a|A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 ICD-10\nICD is a medical classification list that contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. The WHO, which publishes ICD, writes:\n\nClinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in primary, secondary and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics support payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services research. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables large scale research.\n\nICD-10 is widely used and replaced ICD-9 in the US in the 2010s. ICD-11 is the latest version of ICD, with active use beginning in January 2022.\n\nStructure\nAn ICD-10 code can range between 3 and 7 alphanumeric characters and has three major parts (MedicalBillingandCoding 2023):\n\nCategory: A letter followed by two numbers, which describes the general type of injury or disease.\nSubclassification (optional): Up to three digits, further specifying an injury or disease. The subclassification follows the category after a decimal point. Each digit of the subclassification adds more specificity, explaining the cause, manifestation, location, severity, and type of injury or disease.\nExtension (optional): One of three letters describing the type of encounter for a given injury or disease: A (initial encounter), D (subsequent encounter), or S (sequila). The extension follows the subclassification.\n\nBelow is an example of different levels of specificity for an ICD-10 code (MedicalBillingandCoding 2023). The injury is a closed fracture of distal phalanx of right index finger.\n\nS62 – fracture at wrist and hand level\n\nS62.0 – fracture at navicular [scaphoid] bone of wrist\n…\nS62.5 – fracture of thumb\nS62.6 – fracture of other and unspecified finger(s)\n\nS62.60 – fracture of unspecified phalanx of finger\nS62.61 – displaced fracture of proximal phalanx of finger\n…\nS62.63 – displaced fracture of distal phalanx of finger\n\nS62.630 – displaced fracture of distal phalanx of right index finger\n\nS62.630A – … initial encounter for closed fracture\nS62.630B – … initial encounter for open fracture\nS62.630D – … initial encounter for fracture with routine healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 RxNorm\nThe NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm and summarizes its purpose as follows:\n\nRxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software… By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.\n\nIts scope includes the names of prescription and many over-the-counter drugs approved for use in the US, including generic and branded medications. RxNorm does not cover bulk powders, food, dietary supplements, and medical devices.\n\nStructure\nNLM completes the following three steps when classifying a drug (NIH, n.d.):\n\nGroup source data: When NLM receives drug names with different formats that refer to the same medication, it groups them all together and refers to them as synonyms. A group of synonyms is called a concept. Below are examples of synonyms that refer to the same concept:\n\nNaproxen Tab 250 MG\nNaproxen 250mg tablet (product)\nNAPROXEN@250 mg@ORAL@TABLET\nNaproxen 250 MILLIGRAM In 1 TABLET ORAL TABLET\nNAPROXEN 250MG TAB,UD [VA Product]\n\nCreate a normalized name for a concept: After grouping synonyms into a concept, RxNorm creates a normalized name with the ingredient, strength, and dose form. The name also includes if the drug is branded or in a pack. For the concept above, the RxNorm normalized name is “Naproxen 250 MG Oral Tablet.” The branded version is “Naproxen 250 MG Oral Tablet [Prosaid].”\nThe general format for an RxNorm normalized name depends on two factors: (1) generic vs. branded, and (2) single vs. pack. Below summarizes the general formats for each scenario:\n\nGeneric drugs: Ingredient Strength Dose Form\nBranded drugs: Ingredient Strength Dose Form [Brand Name]\nGeneric drug packs: {# (Ingredient Strength Dose Form) / # (Ingredient Strength Dose Form)} Pack\nBranded drug packs: {# (Ingredient Strength Dose Form) / # (Ingredient Strength Dose Form)} Pack [Brand Name]\n\nAssign a concept unique identifier (RXCUI): The RXCUI is a numeric identifier that is a code assigned to a given concept. For example, the RXCUI for the above concept example is 198013.\n\nRxNorm normalized names have different levels of specificity, defined by the term type (TTY). For example, depending on the TTY, an RxNorm normalized name might only include the ingredient, might only include the dose form, or one of many combinations of descriptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view the different TTYs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTY\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nIN\nIngredient\nA compound or moiety that gives the drug its distinctive clinical properties.

Each vaccine also has a short description, a full name, and a status (e.g., Active or Inactive).\nCVX codes are also mapped into groups by disease targeted, and to vaccine manufacturers.",

    "text": "3 Terminology in FHIR\nThere are three key FHIR resources for terminology:\n\nCodeSystem resource: Describes a code system, its concepts, and the codes identifying the concepts. E.g., the LOINC code system.\nValueSet resource: Specifies a specific set of codes from code system(s). E.g., LOINC concepts identifying types of cancer staging systems.\nConceptMap resource: Identifies relationships between sets of concepts. E.g., Mapping from SNOMED CT to ICD-10\n\nWe review these resources in detail below.\n\n3.1 CodeSystem resource details\nThe CodeSystem FHIR resource defines an organized, managed collection of concepts that belong to a given terminology system. The CodeSystem resource represents properties of standard terminologies (like LOINC and ICD-10) in a computable format. These properties include:\n\nThe canonical identifier for the code system (typically a URL like http://loinc.org for LOINC, or an OID like 2.16.840.1.113883.6.1 (which also represents LOINC)\nVersion\nThe concepts defined by the code system\nPublication metadata like a human-readable description, copyright information, and publication date\nProperties of the code system, such as concept permanence, case-sensitivity, and if it defines a compositional grammar.\n\nHere’s an example of a CodeSystem FHIR resource:\n{\n  \"resourceType\" : \"CodeSystem\",\n  \"id\" : \"example\",\n  \"meta\" : {\n    \"profile\" : [\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem\"]\n  },\n  \"text\" : {\n    \"status\" : \"additional\",\n    \"div\" : \"...\"\n  },\n  \"url\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/example\",\n  \"identifier\" : [{\n    \"system\" : \"urn:ietf:rfc:3986\",\n    \"value\" : \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.4.1827\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/identifiers/codesystems\",\n    \"value\" : \"internal-cholesterol-inl\"\n  }],\n  \"version\" : \"5.0.0-cibuild\",\n  \"name\" : \"ACMECholCodesBlood\",\n  \"title\" : \"ACME Codes for Cholesterol in Serum/Plasma\",\n  \"status\" : \"draft\",\n  \"experimental\" : true,\n  \"date\" : \"2016-01-28\",\n  \"publisher\" : \"Acme Co\",\n  \"contact\" : [{\n    \"name\" : \"FHIR project team\",\n    \"telecom\" : [{\n      \"system\" : \"url\",\n      \"value\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir\"\n    }]\n  }],\n  \"description\" : \"This is an example code system that includes all the ACME codes for serum/plasma cholesterol from v2.36.\",\n  \"caseSensitive\" : true,\n  \"content\" : \"complete\",\n  \"filter\" : [{\n    \"code\" : \"acme-plasma\",\n    \"description\" : \"An internal filter used to select codes that are only used with plasma\",\n    \"operator\" : [\"=\"],\n    \"value\" : \"the value of this filter is either 'true' or 'false'\"\n  }],\n  \"concept\" : [{\n    \"code\" : \"chol-mmol\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol (mmol/L)\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol, in mmol/L\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"From ACME POC Testing\"\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\" : \"chol-mass\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol (mg/L)\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol, in mg/L\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"From Paragon Labs\"\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\" : \"chol\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"Obdurate Labs uses this with both kinds of units...\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\nResearch applications\nPotential research applications include:\n\nIdentifying which code system a given code comes from.\nLooking up the concept definition or other metadata associated with a given code.\nUsing concept relationship metadata to reason about or filter data.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 ValueSet resource details\nThe ValueSet FHIR resource “specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context.” ValueSets don’t refer directly to CodeSystems; rather, they identify the relevant CodeSystem by its URI.\nHere’s an example of a ValueSet FHIR resource:\n{\n  \"resourceType\" : \"ValueSet\",\n  \"id\" : \"example-cpt-all\",\n  \"text\" : {\n    \"status\" : \"generated\",\n    \"div\" : \"...\"\n  },\n  \"url\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-cpt-all\",\n  \"identifier\" : [{\n    \"system\" : \"urn:ietf:rfc:3986\",\n    \"value\" : \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.3.3138\"\n  }],\n  \"version\" : \"5.0.0-cibuild\",\n  \"name\" : \"AllCPTCodes\",\n  \"title\" : \"All CPT codes\",\n  \"status\" : \"active\",\n  \"experimental\" : true,\n  \"date\" : \"2015-03-12\",\n  \"publisher\" : \"Health Level Seven International (Vocabulary)\",\n  \"description\" : \"A value set that includes all CPT codes\",\n  \"useContext\" : [{\n    \"code\" : {\n      \"system\" : \"http://example.org/fhir/CodeSystem/use-contexts\",\n      \"code\" : \"species\"\n    },\n    \"valueCodeableConcept\" : {\n      \"coding\" : [{\n        \"system\" : \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n        \"code\" : \"337915000\",\n        \"display\" : \"Homo sapiens (organism)\"\n      }]\n    }\n  }],\n  \"jurisdiction\" : [{\n    \"coding\" : [{\n      \"system\" : \"urn:iso:std:iso:3166\",\n      \"code\" : \"US\"\n    }]\n  }],\n  \"copyright\" : \"CPT Copyright © 2014 American Medical Association.

You can copy it to a requirements.txt file and use your own Python tooling. This way is not recommended.\n\nIf you installed RStudio: go to “File &gt; Open Project…”, and navigate to the folder of your cloned repo. You should see a fhir-for-research.Rproj file in this folder – if you do, that’s the right folder. Then run renv::restore() in the R Console to load all the R dependencies\nIf you did not install RStudio: open terminal and run Rscript -e \"renv::restore()\"\n\nNote: Running quarto check in your Terminal will return what components of Quarto have been installed properly and where there might be issues."

If it’s the same thing as a previous sentence, consider removing.\nExceptions are when the repetition:\n\nis intentional to solidify understanding\nprovides a new perspective\n\n\nEach sentence or phrase is meaningful.\n\nDoes the meaning of the paragraph change if you remove the sentence or phrase? If not, remove.\nExample “At its most basic definition, terminology in IT refers to a code mapping to a concept.”\n\nYou can remove “At its most basic definition” without losing meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck each sentence for the following:\n\nEach word has a unique purpose.\n\nIf you remove the word, does the meaning of the sentence change? If not, remove the word.\nExample “These meet virtually on a weekly basis for a conference call.”\n\nvirtually and conference call are redundant: only one is necessary.\n\n\n“Very” and “really” are absent.\n\nCtrl-f for “very” and “really”. Remove these words.\nIf necessary, replace the verb or adjective with a more description verb or adjective.\n\nExamples “It’s really good.”\n\n“It’s excellent.”\n\n\n\nAdverbs are rare. Use them only when you can’t replace them with a more descriptive verb.\n\nCtrl-f for “ly”. For each adverb you find:\n\nDoes the meaning of the sentence change if you remove the adverb? If not, remove.\nCan you replace the modified verb with a more descriptive verb and remove the adverb? Use a thesaurus for this. If so, replace the verb and remove the adverb.\nIf you can’t remove or replace the adverb, keep it.\n\nExample “developing multiple resources specifically for that purpose.”\n\nspecifically is unnecessary.\n\nExample “There is only one hierarchical relationship attribute.”\n\nonly is redundant to one.\n\nExample “She ran quickly”\n\n“She sprinted”\n\nExample “Adverbs and adjectives appear infrequently.”\n\n“Adverbs and adjectives are rare.”\n\n\nNominalizations are rare. (Nominalizations are verbs that have become nouns. They often end in “ion” or “ing”)\n\nCtrl-f for “ion” or “ing”. Does this word have a verb as a root? If so, can you replace the verb/“ion”-word combination with the root verb?\nExample “The sentence provides an explanation.”\n\nexplanation is a nominalization of to explain. You can rewrite this sentence as “The sentence explains.”\n\nExample “Her understanding of the situation meant that they could proceed.”\n\nunderstanding is a nominalization of to understand. You can rewrite this sentence as “Because she understood the situation, they could proceed.”\n\n\nSentences are simple, as long as simplicity doesn’t reduce readability.\n\nLook for sentences with 2 or more commas (where the commas aren’t part of a list).\nDoes the sentence have multiple purposes? If so, try dividing it into two separate sentences.\n\nExample “After they went to the park, they drove to a restaurant, and at the restaurant, they had dinner.”\n\nThe sentence says what they did after the park, and what they did at the restaurant.\n“After they went to the park, they drove to a restaurant. At the restaurant, they had dinner.”\n\n\nCan you reorganize or rewrite the sentence to use fewer commas?\n\nExample “In many cases, the reverse mappings are valid, but this cannot be assumed to be the case.”\n\n“Reverse mappings are sometimes valid, but not always.”\nor just “Reverse mappings may not be valid.”\n\nExample “Using standard terminology should be a simple and logical step in health IT. However, with the complexities of many diagnoses systems, clinical narrative transferred via PDF format, various coding systems, and the cost of digitizing volumes of reference material/dictionaries, it isn’t as easy as you would think.”\n\n“Using standard terminology is more difficult than expected given:\n\nthe complexities of many diagnoses systems,\nclinical narrative transferred via PDF format,\nvarious coding systems, and\nthe cost of digitizing volumes of reference material/dictionaries”\n\n\n\nIs the concept split into two parts with something in the middle? If so, move whatever is in the middle at the beginning or end.\n\nExample “Her dog, who was so cute, chased the ball.”\n\n“who was so cute” divides “Her dog chased the ball” in half.\n“Her adorable dog chased the ball.” is better.\n\n\n\nYou avoid jargon\n\nExample “Note in the first row that Patient also has a type, which gives inheritance of additional attributes we’ll discuss below.”\n\ninheritance is a software development concept that likely won’t be easily understood by people who aren’t already familiar with HL7 data types or software development.\nInstead, define inheritance inline or use a different word.\n\n\nYou use plain language. You use simpler words where the simple word has the same meaning.\n\nExample Try words like “use” instead of “utilize,” “about” instead of “approximately” and “try” instead of “attempt.”\nExample\n\nOriginal: “It is suggested that the wire should be connected to the terminal by the engineer when the switch-box assembly is completed.”\nSimplified: “We suggest that you connect the wire to the terminal when you finish assembling the switch-box.”"

Use the full element path including the resource name unless it’s too unwieldy/repetitive.\n\nDon’t hyperlink Patient.name directly, but if it’s useful to link to the element details, you can do it like so:\n\nThe Patient.name element (details here) stores one or more names associated with an individual.\n\nLinks to the FHIR spec should be…\n\n…to the current version (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html) if you are generally referring to something in the spec in a way that is version-independent.\n…to a specific version if you are referring to something specific – like a specific element or quoting the spec – that could change over time you should link to a specific version (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/patient.html)\n\nA heuristic for this: if you think the link might be broken in a future FHIR release, use a release-specific link.\nLikewise, if you refer to content that might change (even if the link still resolves), use a release-specific link.\nIf we want to “upgrade” the documentation in the future, we can search for all instances of https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/, and then check those links for"

While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers, Clinical, and Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.\n\n\n\nNote that this links to a specific version of FHIR (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/modules.html) as it is a direct quote.\nAlso note that the hyperlinks in the excerpt are maintained in the blockquote. The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy from the FHIR spec and directly paste into the .qmd file.\nWe will often refer to the “Resource Content”/“Profile Content” table for a FHIR resource or profile. This should be implemented as a single screenshot taken on a high DPI screen (like a MacBook screen) at 100% browser zoom for each table.\nScreenshots of profiles’ tables should include the tabs at the top to identify which view of the table is being displayed. The screenshot should be introduced with a link to the profile in question, like below.\nFor example, here is the differential from the Device Metric Observation Profile R4B:\n\nCaptions are not necessary for these screenshots. However, the images still need alt text and should link to the page where the screenshot was taken. Version-specific links should be used.\nThe same approach should be used for these tables in FHIR resources, though it is not necessary to include the tabs.\nHere’s a screenshot from the Observation resource as an example:\n\nNote that the image hyperlink includes the #resource anchor to bring the reader directly to the “Resource Content” table in the documentation.\nIt is ok to only include part of these tables in the screenshot if that is beneficial. The example from Observation above is quite long, and it might be helpful to crop unnecessary parts. If you do this, you should do some lightweight image editing like so:\n\nIf we do this frequently, we can look into standardizing how this is done for consistency."

FHIR is designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data, to be quickly and efficiently exchanged.\nFHIR may be useful across many types of research involving clinical data, including research that requires direct/real time access to clinical data stored in EHRs, spans multiple data sources that can benefit from a common FHIR data model and interface, or integrates directly with an EHR (e.g., clinical decision support; clinical trial matching/registration).\nMore information on FHIR: https://bit.ly/2021-fhir-fact-sheet.\nThe purpose of this survey is to help us understand how you used FHIR previously, especially for research, and what kinds of FHIR/research-related resources and tools you would benefit from.\n\n\nSection 1: Current use of FHIR and future plans\n1.a. Are you currently using FHIR for research? If so, please describe.\n1.b. Are you currently considering FHIR for any new research uses, and if so, can you briefly describe these use cases?\n1.c. What is the most significant obstacle to utilizing FHIR for research in your work? For example: access to FHIR APIs, difficulty in approval process, staff knowledge of FHIR, EHR capabilities, etc.\n1.d. Do you have any other initiatives using FHIR that have built technology, infrastructure, or staff skills that may be applicable to research? If so, please describe.\n\n\nSection 2: EHRs and common data models\n2.a. What EHR vendor(s) do you use (please list each hospital/health system if applicable, and the corresponding EHR)?\n\n\n\nSite\nEHR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.b. How do you currently access deidentified clinical data, and what is the typical deidentification process? E.g., do you have an existing common data model, do one-off data pulls, use a data lake provided by your EHR vendor, and/or etc.?\n2.c. How do you currently access identified clinical data? E.g., do you have an existing common data model, do one-off data pulls, use a data lake provided by your EHR vendor, and/or etc.?\n2.d. Do you use any common data models that are not mentioned in (2.b.) or (2.c.)?\n\n\nSection 3: Use cases\n3.a. We are assessing interest in training around FHIR for research use cases and identifying additional use cases of interest. To this end, please fill in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Case\nWhich role(s) may be interested in this use case? (e.g., PIs, core facility staff, clinical researchers, graduate students, etc.)\nRough number of people in each role (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory overview on FHIR and its potential uses for research\nExample:Graduate studentsEarly career investigators\n5010\n\n\nExtracting data from EHRs, or other FHIR-enabled systems\n\n\n\n\nBuilding cohorts consisting of patients among multiple medical centers\n\n\n\n\nCreate patient-facing FHIR applications for communication or education\n\n\n\n\nPractice-based research with practitioners (e.g., clinical decision support)\n\n\n\n\nAccess particular parts of patients’ EHRs records\n\n\n\n\nConvert FHIR resources into tabular data for analysis in R or Python\n\n\n\n\nadd rows for additional use cases of interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Organizational structure\n4.a. Who in your organization can describe existing data flows related to research? (i.e., how data gets from EHRs into the hands of researchers)\n4.b. Who else should we talk to to learn more about FHIR for research needs or existing professional development efforts related to FHIR?\n4.c. Are there people/groups who have hands-on experience with using FHIR in a research context, and would be willing to provide additional input? If so, please list their contact information.\n4.d. What else do you want us to know?"

    "text": "Basic Setup and Connection (Beginner Level)\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to:\n\nConnect to a FHIR server containing genomic data\nRetrieve basic genetic diagnostic reports\nDisplay genomic information in a structured format\n\nFirst, let’s set up our connection to the FHIR server:\n\n# Load dependency\nimport requests, os\n\nfhir_server = os.environ.get('FHIR_SERVER')\nprint(f\"Using FHIR server: {fhir_server}\")\n\n# Check if the server is running and connection is successful\nresponse = requests.get(f\"{fhir_server}/metadata\")\n\nprint(f\"Server status: {response.status_code}\")\n\nUsing FHIR server: http://localhost:8080/fhir\nServer status: 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the FHIR Metadata Endpoint\n\n\n\nThe metadata endpoint (/metadata) is a special FHIR endpoint that returns the server’s capability statement - a structured document that describes what the server can do. When we query this endpoint:\n\nWe’re checking if the server is responsive (status code 200)\nWe’re verifying it’s a valid FHIR server\nThe response contains details about supported resources, operations, and search parameters\n\nThis is a lightweight way to validate connectivity before attempting more complex queries.\n\n\nIf the server is responsive (code 200), proceed with the next code block.\n\n# Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\nimport re\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom fhir_pyrate import Pirate\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\n\n# Initialize FHIR-PYrate\nsearch = Pirate(\n    auth=None,\n    base_url=fhir_server,\n    print_request_url=True,\n)\n\nNow let’s retrieve basic genetic diagnostic reports.

It allows our genomic analysis recommendations to be delivered to clinicians at the right time and in the right context.\nFor a comprehensive introduction to CDS Hooks, please refer to CDS Hooks Introduction, which covers the fundamental concepts, workflow, and implementation details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDS Hooks at a Glance\n\n\n\nCDS Hooks provides a framework for:\n\nEvent-Driven Integration: Hooks trigger at specific points in clinical workflow\nStandard API: Consistent way for EHRs to communicate with CDS services\nCard-Based Interface: Recommendations delivered as “cards” within EHR UI\nContext-Aware: Services receive patient context to provide relevant advice\n\nCommon Hook Points:\n\npatient-view: When a patient’s record is opened\norder-select: When a medication or procedure is selected\norder-sign: When orders are about to be signed\n\nThe CDS Hooks Workflow\nWhen integrated into a real clinical environment, the CDS Hooks workflow would look like this:\n\nTrigger: A clinician opens a patient’s record, triggering the patient-view hook\nRequest: The EHR sends a request to a CDS service with the patient context\nAnalysis: CDS service queries the FHIR server for relevant genomic data and analyzes variants\nResponse: CDS service returns CDS Hooks cards with clinical recommendations\nDisplay: The EHR displays these recommendations to the clinician within their workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing a CDS Hooks Service for Genomic Analysis\nNow, let’s create a CDS Hooks service to serve our genomic recommendations. This service will:\n\nAnalyze a patient’s genetic data in real-time\nGenerate appropriate clinical recommendations\nReturn these recommendations as CDS Hooks cards\n\nThe service exposes two endpoints:\n\nA discovery endpoint that tells EHRs what services are available\nA service endpoint that processes requests and returns recommendations\n\nWe will use Flask, a lightweight application framework for writing web applications and services using Python.\n\n# Import necessary libraries\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\nimport threading\nimport time\nimport re\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Choose a port for the Flask server\nflask_port = 3299\nflask_server_thread = None\n\n# Create a Flask application\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# CDS Hooks discovery endpoint - this tells EHRs what services we provide\n@app.route('/cds-services', methods=['GET'])\ndef discovery():\n    return jsonify({\n        'services': [\n            {\n                'id': 'genomics-advisor',\n                'hook': 'patient-view',\n                'title': 'Genomics Clinical Advisor',\n                'description': 'Provides recommendations based on genetic findings',\n                #

When a clinician opens a patient’s record in an EHR system, the EHR sends a request to all registered CDS services, allowing them to provide relevant recommendations.\n\n# Let's directly query for genetic reports and work with a patient that definitely has genetic data\nprint(\"Querying for genetic diagnostic reports...\")\ngenetic_reports_dict = search.steal_bundles_to_dataframe(\n    resource_type=\"DiagnosticReport\",\n    request_params={\n        \"code\": \"http://loinc.org|55232-3\",  # Genetic analysis summary panel\n        \"_count\": 5,\n        \"_include\": \"DiagnosticReport:result\",  # Include the Observation resources\n    },\n    num_pages=1,\n    fhir_paths=[\n        (\"id\", \"id\"),\n        (\"subject\", \"subject.reference\"),\n        (\"status\", \"status\"),\n        (\"issued\", \"issued\"),\n    ]\n)\n\n# Display diagnostic reports\ngenetic_reports_df = genetic_reports_dict[\"DiagnosticReport\"]\nprint(f\"Found {len(genetic_reports_df)} genetic reports\")\ndisplay(genetic_reports_df.head())\n    \n# Display observations count if available\nif \"Observation\" in genetic_reports_dict:\n    observations_df = genetic_reports_dict[\"Observation\"]\n    print(f\"Found {len(observations_df)} genetic observations\")\n    \n# Select a patient of interest, as if a clinician selected a patient from the EHR\ntest_patient_id = genetic_reports_df.loc[genetic_reports_df[\"subject\"] == \"Patient/df860bc2-1943-237f-7445-ed960a1ef069\", \"subject\"].values[0]\nprint(f\"Selected patient with genetic data: {test_patient_id}\")\nprint(f\"Testing with patient ID: {test_patient_id}\")\n\nQuerying for genetic diagnostic reports...\nhttp://localhost:8080/fhir/DiagnosticReport?_count=5&_include=DiagnosticReport:result&code=http://loinc.org|55232-3\n\n\nQuery & Build DF (DiagnosticReport):   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]Query & Build DF (DiagnosticReport): 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 46.06it/s]\n\n\nFound 5 genetic reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nsubject\nstatus\nissued\n\n\n\n\n0\n53db09ba-0414-61e1-78d2-02b20a7092b8\nPatient/837e80f6-a7a5-77f8-36aa-c7b8ff002c4b\nfinal\n2001-02-25T10:39:54.395-05:00\n\n\n1\nc012aa9a-fe79-40bc-00ae-162c9906c6f8\nPatient/39533e4a-f6f2-a144-ab37-6500460250dc\nfinal\n2017-02-21T03:33:40.769-05:00\n\n\n2\n27e51912-a805-26dc-b9c8-d88f131969a6\nPatient/68c3ae0b-e298-62b7-5d3a-7936fd998fe0\nfinal\n1989-10-03T04:33:40.769-04:00\n\n\n3\na31d8d94-6acd-a5f0-618a-f1b38746f9e4\nPatient/df860bc2-1943-237f-7445-ed960a1ef069\nfinal\n1992-02-10T08:04:51.390-05:00\n\n\n4\n1e5e18ae-bad4-3a45-b4e3-d2c7b7da66d9\nPatient/7d9ba758-f0b8-3fc3-befa-f0e8e8fb6935\nfinal\n2007-11-23T16:23:59.928-05:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFound 159 genetic observations\nSelected patient with genetic data: Patient/df860bc2-1943-237f-7445-ed960a1ef069\nTesting with patient ID: Patient/df860bc2-1943-237f-7445-ed960a1ef069\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting Locally vs. Production\n\n\n\nIn production, EHR systems would send requests directly to your CDS Hooks service. Since we’re developing locally, we need to manually mock these requests to test our service without connecting to a real EHR system.\n\n\n\n# Create a request with the selected patient\nmock_request = {\n    \"hook\": \"patient-view\",\n    \"hookInstance\": \"d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea\",\n    \"context\": {\n        \"patientId\": test_patient_id\n    }\n}\n\n# Send the request to our CDS service\nprint(\"Sending request to CDS service...\")\nservice_response = requests.post(\n    f\"http://localhost:{flask_port}/cds-services/genomics-advisor\", \n    json=mock_request\n)\n\n# Display the JSON response from our service\nprint(\"\\nCDS Service Response:\")\nprint(json.dumps(service_response.json(), indent=2))\n\nSending request to CDS service...\n\nCDS Service Response:\n{\n  \"cards\": [\n    {\n      \"detail\": \"Consider cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid-lowering therapy\",\n      \"indicator\": \"info\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"label\": \"Cardiovascular Guidelines\"\n      },\n      \"summary\": \"PON1 Risk Variant Detected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"detail\": \"Associated with obesity and insulin resistance\",\n      \"indicator\": \"info\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"label\": \"Metabolic Guidelines\"\n      },\n      \"summary\": \"FTO Risk Variant Detected\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"detail\": \"Associated with inflammatory processes and stroke risk\",\n      \"indicator\": \"warning\",\n      \"source\": {\n        \"label\": \"Stroke Risk Guidelines\"\n      },\n      \"summary\": \"CCL2 Pathogenic Variant Detected\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nThe response contains CDS cards with our recommendations. These cards would typically be displayed directly in the EHR interface to help clinicians make informed decisions. Let’s create a visual representation of how these cards might appear in an EHR system:\n\n# Extract the CDS cards from the response\ncards = service_response.json().get('cards', [])\n\n# Create a simple HTML visualization to show how these cards would appear in an EHR\nhtml_output = f\"\"\"\n&lt;div style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 15px; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;\"&gt;\n    &lt;div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px;\"&gt;\n        &lt;h3 style=\"margin-top: 0;\"&gt;EHR Patient View: {test_patient_id}&lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;div style=\"color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;\"&gt;Genomic Decision Support&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #e9ecef; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 3px;\"&gt;\n        &lt;p style=\"margin: 0; font-size: 0.9em; color: #6c757d;\"&gt;\n            &lt;strong&gt;Demo Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a simulation of how CDS Hooks would appear in an EHR. \n            The buttons shown below are not functional in this demo.

    "text": "Summary and Next Steps\nCongratulations on completing this tutorial on genomic clinical decision support! We’ve explored how to build a CDS service that can identify clinically relevant genomic variants and deliver actionable recommendations to clinicians at the point of care.\nIn this tutorial, we’ve covered:\n\nBasic genomic data retrieval from FHIR servers\nVariant analysis and extraction of clinically relevant information\nImplementation of a CDS Hooks service to deliver genomic recommendations\nIntegration simulation showing how the service would appear in an EHR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Implementation Considerations for Production Deployment\n\n\n\nMoving a prototype CDS service to production involves significant security, compliance, and safety concerns. Improper implementation could pose risks to patient care and data security.\nTo extend this work in a production environment, you would need to:\n\nHost the Service:\n\nDeploy on a secure, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure with HTTPS and appropriate security measures\n\nImplement Authentication:\n\nUse industry-standard authentication protocols supported by your EHR\n\nUpdate Clinical Knowledge:\n\nStore clinical recommendations in a database rather than hardcoded values\nEstablish a regular review cycle with clinical experts\n\nAdd Robust Error Handling:\n\nImplement comprehensive exception handling, logging, and monitoring\nDevelop a comprehensive test suite\n\nTest with Users:\n\nConduct usability testing with actual clinicians\nStart with a limited pilot before full deployment\nImplement feedback mechanisms\n\n\nRemember that clinical decision support systems directly impact patient care—making robust implementation both an ethical and legal obligation.",

Standards like FHIR help to establish a common language and a common process for health IT to share information more seamlessly and more efficiently.\nThe moniker—FHIR— stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. “Fast” refers to the design and implementation of the standard—it was designed to be easier for developers to work with than the prevailing health IT standards of a decade ago—and “resources” refers to the building blocks of FHIR. More on that later.\nFHIR is open-source, so it’s free to use, and it is modular. Resources and other constructs in FHIR allow people to assemble solutions that meet their needs in a specific use case, and customizability is built into FHIR throughout its design, including through FHIR features like extensions and profiling, which we’ll talk about more later on."

    "text": "FHIR Information Flow\n\nFHIR information flow diagram showing client, API, and server interactions\nNow that we’ve introduced the kinds of data FHIR can represent, we’ll talk about how these data can be moved around using FHIR. The key phrase here is APIs, or application programming interfaces. This diagram shows a standard FHIR-facilitated flow of information. Typically, when systems use FHIR, there’s a FHIR client, which is over on the left on the slide. That client could be an app, or it could be a user interface on a computer, or it could be the back-end of a research server. That client, such as a patient’s iPhone app, uses the FHIR API to connect to a patient’s provider’s EHR and pull down the data. The client could also be a research application, or something like a clinical decision support system that is integrated into an EHR.\nAll these use the same underlying approach for asking for data from the FHIR server, which is requests being sent via an HTTP RESTful API. RESTful APIs are a common web technology, used by many different tools, not just FHIR, and the fact they’re common outside of health care is one reason developers find them easier to work with.\nThe FHIR web server it is querying could be part of an EHR, or it could be a standalone server, and the FHIR web server can communicate with underlying data systems that store the data and then convert those data into FHIR format like what we just saw and send them back to the client."
