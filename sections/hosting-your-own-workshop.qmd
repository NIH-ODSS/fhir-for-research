If you are interested in **hosting your own workshop**, the following guides will be useful. These are based on NIH/ODSS's experience conducting the [FHIR Bulk Data Access](/workshops/bulk-data/index.qmd) and [SMART on FHIR](/workshops/smart-on-fhir/index.qmd) workshops.

*Recommended: complete the [hands-on practice](/sections/hands-on-practice.qmd) workshops for reviewing your FHIR skills and inspiring your own workshop.*

1. Review these [recommendations for conducting workshops](/webinars/workshop-recommendations/index.qmd).
2. Setup your own [FHIR Test Server](/modules/synthea-test-server.qmd)
3. Procure privacy-compliant [synthetic data](/modules/synthetic-data.qmd)
